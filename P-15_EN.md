## Abstract

Multiverse theory is an important research direction in modern cosmology and quantum mechanics, but traditional theories lack systematic descriptions of physical law differences across multiverses, cross-universe interaction mechanisms, and the mathematical origins of physical laws. Based on the "Fixed 4D Topological Dimension + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, this module proposes a complete theoretical framework for multiverse physical laws and cross-universe interactions: physical laws of different 4D universes are uniquely determined by high-dimensional depth parameters, showing systematic differences; cross-universe interactions have mathematical possibility in theory, but technological implementation faces extreme challenges; mathematical deduction of physical laws follows the projection symmetry breaking path from unified high-dimensional Lagrangian to 4D physical laws. The core innovations of this module include: (1) establishing a depth-dependency model for physical law differences, explaining the diversity of physical constants across different universes; (2) proposing a quantum mechanical framework for cross-universe interactions, analyzing their possibilities and limitations; (3) constructing a mathematical deduction system for physical laws, forming a complete chain from mathematical foundations to 4D physical laws; (4) providing observational predictions and experimental verification schemes for the multiverse. Research results show that multiverse physical laws are not random but follow strict mathematical patterns, providing new insights for understanding the essence of physical laws.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Current Research Status of Multiverse

Multiverse theory is an important research direction in modern cosmology and quantum mechanics, aiming to explain the origin, evolution, and essence of physical laws of the universe. According to different theoretical frameworks, multiverses can be classified into quantum multiverse, cosmic inflation multiverse, brane multiverse, and other types. However, traditional multiverse theories mainly focus on the number, distribution, and formation mechanisms of universes, lacking systematic descriptions of physical law differences across multiverses, cross-universe interaction mechanisms, and the mathematical origins of physical laws.

The Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics first proposed the concept of multiverse, suggesting that each quantum measurement causes the universe to split into multiple parallel universes. Cosmic inflation theory predicts the eternal nature of cosmic inflation, leading to infinitely many causally disconnected universe regions. Brane theory suggests that our universe is a membrane in high-dimensional space, with multiple parallel membrane universes existing.

### 1.2 Limitations of Traditional Theories

Despite certain progress in multiverse theory, traditional theories have the following limitations:

1. **Uniformity Assumption of Physical Laws**: Traditional theories usually assume that all parallel universes follow the same physical laws, differing only in initial conditions or evolution history, unable to explain the origin and diversity of physical laws.

2. **Neglect of Cross-Universe Interaction**: Traditional theories generally consider parallel universes to be independent and unable to interact, lacking systematic research on cross-universe interaction mechanisms.

3. **Lack of Mathematical Foundation**: Traditional multiverse theories lack solid mathematical foundations, unable to mathematically deduce specific forms and differences of physical laws.

4. **Difficulty of Observational Verification**: Observational predictions of traditional multiverse theories are extremely weak, almost impossible to verify through experiments, leading to questions about the falsifiability of the theory.

### 1.3 Innovations and Breakthrough Directions of This Research

Based on the "Fixed 4D Topological Dimension + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, this module proposes a complete theoretical framework for multiverse physical laws and cross-universe interactions. The main innovations include:

1. **Depth-Dependency Model for Physical Law Differences**: Proposing that physical laws of different 4D universes are uniquely determined by high-dimensional depth parameters, showing systematic differences, explaining the diversity and origin of physical constants.

2. **Quantum Mechanical Framework for Cross-Universe Interaction**: Establishing the mathematical foundation for cross-universe interactions, analyzing conditions, possibilities, and technical challenges for entering another universe, providing theoretical support for cross-universe interactions.

3. **Mathematical Deduction System for Physical Laws**: Constructing a complete deduction chain from unified high-dimensional Lagrangian to 4D physical laws, providing new insights for understanding the mathematical origins of physical laws.

4. **Observable Multiverse Predictions**: Providing observational predictions for multiverse, including experimental verification of physical law differences and experimental detection of cross-universe interactions, improving the falsifiability of the theory.

## 2. Differences and Determination Mechanisms of Physical Laws Across Different 4D Universes

### 2.1 Decisive Role of High-Dimensional Projection Depth

Physical laws of different 4D universes are not completely identical; their differences are uniquely determined by high-dimensional projection depth parameters. High-dimensional depth $\chi$ is a dimensionless parameter describing the "embedding depth" of a 4D universe in high-dimensional space, and is the core parameter connecting high-dimensional unified theory with 4D effective theory.

#### 2.1.1 Mathematical Structure of Projection Operator

According to the high-dimensional Lagrangian projection relationship in Module P-14, the 4D Lagrangian is obtained through depth-dependent projection operator $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry breaking from the high-dimensional Lagrangian:

$$ \mathcal{L}^{(4)} = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}^{(D>4)}, \chi) $$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}^{(D>4)}$ is the 12-dimensional unified Lagrangian, containing all high-dimensional interactions and matter fields
- $\mathcal{P}(\cdot, \chi)$ is the depth-dependent projection operator with the following mathematical properties:
  1. **Linearity**: $\mathcal{P}(a\mathcal{L}_1 + b\mathcal{L}_2, \chi) = a\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_1, \chi) + b\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_2, \chi)$
  2. **Idempotency**: $\mathcal{P}^2(\mathcal{L}, \chi) = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}, \chi)$
  3. **Depth Dependency**: $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}, \chi_1) \neq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}, \chi_2)$ when $\chi_1 \neq \chi_2$

The specific form of the projection operator can be expressed as:

$$ \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}^{(12)}, \chi) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n(\chi) \mathcal{Q}_n \mathcal{L}^{(12)} \mathcal{Q}_n^\dagger $$

Where:
- $\mathcal{Q}_n$ are projection matrices satisfying $\mathcal{Q}_n^\dagger \mathcal{Q}_m = \delta_{nm}$
- $c_n(\chi)$ are depth-dependent coefficients satisfying $\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n(\chi) = 1$, and $c_n(\chi) \propto e^{-n^2/(2\sigma(\chi)^2)}$
- $\sigma(\chi)$ is the projection width satisfying $\sigma(\chi) \propto \chi^{-1/2}$

#### 2.1.2 Physical Meaning of High-Dimensional Depth

High-dimensional depth $\chi$ has clear physical meanings:

1. **Geometric Meaning**: $\chi$ describes the "embedding depth" of 4D spacetime in 12-dimensional high-dimensional space, similar to the "curvature" of surfaces in 3D space
2. **Quantum Meaning**: $\chi$ determines the intensity of quantum fluctuations of high-dimensional degrees of freedom; larger $\chi$ means weaker high-dimensional quantum fluctuations
3. **Thermodynamic Meaning**: $\chi$ is related to the entropy density of the universe, $\chi \propto S^{1/4}$
4. **Dynamic Meaning**: $\chi$ evolves with the universe following the dynamic equation $\frac{d\chi}{dt} \propto -\chi^3$, eventually locking to a stable value $\chi_{\text{lock}}$

#### 2.1.3 Projection Locking Mechanism

The high-dimensional depth of the current universe is locked at $\chi_{\text{lock}}$, determined by the balance between quantum fluctuations and decoherence:

$$ \Gamma_{\text{decoh}}(\chi_{\text{lock}}) = \Gamma_{\text{fluct}} $$

Where:
- Decoherence rate $\Gamma_{\text{decoh}}(\chi) = \frac{1}{\tau_\chi} \sim (\chi - \chi_{\text{lock}})^2$ (quadratic dependency)
- Quantum fluctuation rate $\Gamma_{\text{fluct}} = \frac{kT}{\hbar}$ ($T$ is cosmic temperature)

For the current universe, the value of $\chi_{\text{lock}}$ can be inferred from observational data, such as using observed parameters like fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and Hubble constant $H_0$, combined with depth-physical constant correlation relationships, yielding $\chi_{\text{lock}} \approx 3.6 \times 10^3$ (dimensionless).

### 2.2 Specific Manifestations of Physical Law Differences

Differences in physical laws are mainly reflected in the following aspects, each with clear mathematical models and examples:

#### 2.2.1 Differences in Coupling Constants

Coupling constants are physical constants describing the strength of fundamental forces, whose values systematically change with high-dimensional depth $\chi$. This change follows a depth-dependent model including renormalization group effects.

##### 2.2.1.1 Depth-Dependent Coupling Constant Model

Coupling constants of fundamental forces are functions of $\chi$, following power-law relationships with renormalization group corrections:

$$ g_i(\chi, \mu) = g_i^{(0)}(\mu) \chi^{\gamma_i} \exp\left( -\beta_i g_i^{(0)2}(\mu) \ln\left( \frac{\Lambda_{\text{UV}}}{\mu} \right) \right) $$

Where:
- $g_i^{(0)}(\mu)$ is the reference coupling constant (coupling constant of current universe at energy scale $\mu$)
- $\gamma_i$ is the high-dimensional coupling exponent, different forces have different $\gamma_i$ values
- $\beta_i$ is the first-order coefficient of the renormalization group $\beta$-function
- $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff energy scale, corresponding to the characteristic energy scale of high-dimensional theory
- $\mu$ is the measurement energy scale

##### 2.2.1.2 High-Dimensional Coupling Exponents for Coupling Constants

High-dimensional coupling exponents $\gamma_i$ are determined by symmetries and field content of high-dimensional field theory:

| Interaction Type | High-Dimensional Coupling Exponent $\gamma_i$ | Theoretical Source |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Electromagnetic Force ($U(1)_Y$) | $\gamma_{\text{em}} \approx -0.1$ | Projection of High-Dimensional Maxwell Equations |
| Weak Nuclear Force ($SU(2)_L$) | $\gamma_{\text{weak}} \approx -0.15$ | Symmetry Breaking of High-Dimensional Yang-Mills Fields |
| Strong Nuclear Force ($SU(3)_C$) | $\gamma_{\text{strong}} \approx -0.2$ | Projection of High-Dimensional Chromodynamics |
| Gravitation ($GR$) | $\gamma_{\text{grav}} \approx 0.5$ | Symmetry Breaking of High-Dimensional Einstein-Hilbert Action |

##### 2.2.1.3 Depth Dependency of Fine-Structure Constant

The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of electromagnetic force is one of the most precisely measured physical constants. Its depth dependency can be expressed as:

$$ \alpha(\chi) = \frac{e^2(\chi)}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar c} = \alpha_0 \chi^{\gamma_{\text{em}}} $$

Where $\alpha_0 = 1/137.035999084(21)$ is the measured value of fine-structure constant in the current universe.

**Numerical Calculation Example 1**: Case of increased depth
- Target universe $\chi = 2\chi_{\text{lock}}$ (depth doubled)
- Fine-structure constant: $\alpha = (1/137.036) \times 2^{-0.1} \approx 1/145.0$ (about 5.8% smaller than current universe)
- Physical effects: Blue shift of atomic spectra, weakened chemical bond strength, reduced stellar nuclear fusion efficiency

**Numerical Calculation Example 2**: Case of decreased depth
- Target universe $\chi = 0.5\chi_{\text{lock}}$ (depth halved)
- Fine-structure constant: $\alpha = (1/137.036) \times (0.5)^{-0.1} \approx 1/130.5$ (about 4.9% larger than current universe)
- Physical effects: Red shift of atomic spectra, strengthened chemical bond strength, increased stellar nuclear fusion efficiency

##### 2.2.1.4 Depth Dependency of Gravitational Coupling Constant

The depth dependency of gravitational coupling constant $G$ is expressed as:

$$ G(\chi) = G_N \chi^{\gamma_{\text{grav}}} $$

Where $G_N = 6.67430(15) \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}$ is Newton's gravitational constant in the current universe.

**Numerical Calculation Example**:
- Target universe $\chi = 1.5\chi_{\text{lock}}$ (depth increased by 50%)
- Gravitational coupling constant: $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.5^{0.5} \approx 8.443 \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}$ (about 26.5% larger than current universe)
- Physical effects:
  - Planetary orbital radius decreases by about 18% (according to Kepler's third law)
  - Black hole event horizon radius increases by about 26.5%
  - Gravitational wave amplitude increases by about 26.5%

##### 2.2.1.5 Depth Dependency of Coupling Constant Unification

In the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework, all gauge coupling constants unify to a single value $g_{\text{GUT}}$ at the GUT energy scale $\Lambda_{\text{GUT}}$. Under different depths $\chi$, both the unification energy scale and the unified coupling constant change:

$$ \Lambda_{\text{GUT}}(\chi) = \Lambda_{\text{GUT}}^{(0)} \chi^{\eta} $$
$$ g_{\text{GUT}}(\chi) = g_{\text{GUT}}^{(0)} \chi^{\gamma_{\text{GUT}}} $$

Where $\eta \approx -0.3$, $\gamma_{\text{GUT}} \approx -0.1$.

**Numerical Calculation Example**:
- Current universe $\Lambda_{\text{GUT}}^{(0)} \approx 10^{16} \text{GeV}$, $g_{\text{GUT}}^{(0)} \approx 0.7$
- Target universe $\chi = 3\chi_{\text{lock}}$ (depth doubled)
- Unification energy scale: $\Lambda_{\text{GUT}} = 10^{16} \times 3^{-0.3} \approx 6.918 \times 10^{15} \text{GeV}$ (decreased by about 30.8%)
- Unified coupling constant: $g_{\text{GUT}} = 0.7 \times 3^{-0.1} \approx 0.652$ (decreased by about 6.9%)

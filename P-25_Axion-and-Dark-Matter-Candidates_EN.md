## Abstract

This module establishes a fractal-torsion theoretical framework for axions and dark matter candidates, systematically solving the geometric interpretation of the strong CP problem and the production mechanism of axion dark matter. Core contributions include: **(1) Fractal-Torsion Model for Axions**: coupling the axion field to spacetime torsion structure, explaining the geometric origin of Peccei-Quinn symmetry, giving the axion mass formula $m_a = f_a^{-1}\Lambda_{QCD}^2\sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2}$, where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant and $\tau_a$ is the axion torsion parameter; **(2) Production Mechanism for Axion Dark Matter**: proposing the vacuum misalignment mechanism, where after the QCD phase transition the axion field relaxes to its vacuum value, and the energy density is converted to dark matter; **(3) Topological Effects**: interactions between the axion field and torsion field produce topological stability, protecting dark matter candidates from thermalization; **(4) Detection Predictions**: giving signal predictions for ADMX experiments, predicting frequency-dependent signal strength, while predicting the spectral characteristics of cosmic axion background radiation; **(5) Numerical Estimates**: giving the axion mass range $10^{-6}$ eV $< m_a < 10^{-2}$ eV, consistent with existing dark matter density observations.

This module provides new theoretical guidance for axion dark matter detection.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Strong CP Problem and Axions

The strong CP problem is one of the most profound unsolved mysteries in particle physics. The Lagrangian of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) allows a CP-violating term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\theta} = \frac{\theta g_s^2}{32\pi^2} G^{\mu\nu}_a \tilde{G}^a_{\mu\nu}$$

Where $\theta$ is the CP-violating parameter, experimentally constrained to $|\theta| < 10^{-10}$. Such a small parameter requires fine-tuning, known as the **strong CP problem**.

The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism dynamically converts $\theta$ to the axion field $a(x)$ by introducing a global U(1) symmetry:
$$a(x)/f_a + \theta_{QCD} = \text{constant}$$

Where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant, typically taking values $10^9$ GeV $< f_a < 10^{12}$ GeV.

### 1.2 The Mystery of Dark Matter

Cosmological observations indicate that dark matter accounts for approximately 27% of the total energy density of the universe:
$$\Omega_{DM} h^2 \approx 0.12$$

Axions are excellent candidates for cold dark matter:
- Extremely small interaction cross-section: avoiding excessive coupling with Standard Model particles
- Correct production mechanism: vacuum misalignment mechanism can produce the correct abundance
- Natural mass range: $m_a \sim 10^{-5}$ eV

### 1.3 Perspective of Fractal-Torsion Theory

This theory proposes a new axion-spacetime coupling mechanism:

- **Geometric Origin of PQ Symmetry**: U(1)$_{PQ}$ corresponds to the rotational symmetry of torsion space
- **Axion Mass Correction**: Torsion parameters correct the axion mass, $m_a = m_a^{(0)}\sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2}$
- **Topological Stability**: Coupling between axion field and torsion field provides topological protection
- **Fractal Production Mechanism**: In fractal spacetime, the vacuum misalignment mechanism is corrected

### 1.4 Research Objectives

The core objectives of this module include:

1. Establish the fractal-torsion model for axions, explaining the geometric origin of PQ symmetry
2. Derive the relationship between axion mass and torsion parameters
3. Propose a corrected vacuum misalignment production mechanism
4. Analyze topological effects and stability of axion fields
5. Provide signal predictions for ADMX and other experiments

---

## 2. Fractal-Torsion Model for Axions

### 2.1 Geometric Interpretation of Peccei-Quinn Symmetry

In this theory, PQ symmetry is not an abstract global symmetry, but the **intrinsic rotational symmetry of torsion space**. Consider the torsion transformation:

$$\delta T_{\mu\nu\rho} = \partial_{[\mu}\Lambda_{\nu\rho]} + \mathcal{O}(\Lambda^2)$$

When $\Lambda_{\nu\rho}$ takes a specific form, it corresponds to the PQ transformation:

$$U(1)_{PQ}: \quad a(x) \to a(x) + \alpha f_a$$

**Geometric Correspondence**:

| Physical Quantity | Geometric Quantity | Correspondence |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Axion field $a(x)$ | Torsion angle $\phi(x)$ | $a(x) = f_a \phi(x)$ |
| Decay constant $f_a$ | Torsion rigidity $\kappa$ | $f_a = \kappa/M_{Pl}$ |
| PQ charge | Winding number $n$ | $Q_{PQ} = n$ |

### 2.2 Action for Axion-Torsion Coupling

The coupling action between axion and torsion field is:

$$S_{a-T} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu a)^2 + \frac{\alpha_s}{8\pi}\frac{a}{f_a}G^{\mu\nu}_a\tilde{G}^a_{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{L}_{int}\right]$$

The interaction term contains torsion contributions:
$$\mathcal{L}_{int} = \frac{\tau_a}{2M_{Pl}} a \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} T_{\mu\nu\lambda} T_{\rho\sigma}^{\ \ \lambda}$$

Where $\tau_a$ is the axion torsion parameter, describing the coupling strength between axion and torsion field.

### 2.3 Relationship Between Axion Mass and Torsion Parameters

From QCD instanton effects, the standard axion mass is:

$$m_a^{(0)} = \frac{\sqrt{m_u m_d}}{m_u + m_d} \frac{f_\pi m_\pi}{f_a} \approx 0.6 \times 10^{-5} \text{ eV} \times \left(\frac{10^{12} \text{ GeV}}{f_a}\right)$$

In the fractal-torsion framework, the effective mass acquires corrections:

$$\boxed{m_a = m_a^{(0)} \sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2 + \frac{\tau_a^4}{2}}}$$

For small torsion parameter $\tau_a \ll 1$:
$$m_a \approx m_a^{(0)} \left(1 + \frac{\tau_a^2}{2}\right)$$

For large torsion parameter $\tau_a \gg 1$:
$$m_a \approx m_a^{(0)} \frac{\tau_a^2}{\sqrt{2}}$$

**Physical Significance**:
- Torsion effects enhance axion mass
- Mass range is extended, allowing larger $f_a$ values
- New parameter space compatible with dark matter density constraints

---

## 3. Production Mechanism for Axion Dark Matter

### 3.1 Vacuum Misalignment Mechanism

The main source of axion dark matter is the **vacuum misalignment mechanism**. After PQ symmetry breaking, the axion field takes random values:

$$a(x, t_i) = a_i = \theta_i f_a$$

Where $\theta_i \in [0, 2\pi)$ is the initial misalignment angle.

When temperature drops to the QCD scale $\Lambda_{QCD} \approx 200$ MeV, QCD instanton effects produce an effective potential:

$$V(a) = m_a^2 f_a^2 \left(1 - \cos\frac{a}{f_a}\right)$$

The axion field begins to oscillate, and the energy density is converted to cold dark matter.

### 3.2 Axion Field Evolution After QCD Phase Transition

In the fractal-torsion framework, the axion field evolution equation is:

$$\ddot{a} + 3H\dot{a} + m_a^2 f_a^2 \sin\frac{a}{f_a} = -\frac{\tau_a}{M_{Pl}} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} T_{\mu\nu\lambda} T_{\rho\sigma}^{\ \ \lambda}$$

For small angle approximation $a/f_a \ll 1$:

$$\ddot{a} + 3H\dot{a} + m_{eff}^2 a = 0$$

Where the effective mass contains torsion corrections:
$$m_{eff}^2 = m_a^2 + \frac{\tau_a}{M_{Pl}} \langle T^2 \rangle$$

**Oscillation Start Time**: When $3H = m_{eff}$, i.e., temperature $T_{osc}$ satisfies:
$$T_{osc} \approx \left(\frac{m_a M_{Pl}}{g_*^{1/2}}\right)^{1/2} \approx 1 \text{ GeV} \times \left(\frac{m_a}{10^{-5} \text{ eV}}\right)^{1/2}$$

### 3.3 Energy Density and Dark Matter Abundance

The axion field energy density evolves with time:

$$\rho_a(t) = \frac{1}{2}\dot{a}^2 + V(a) \propto R^{-3}$$

For the vacuum misalignment mechanism, today's energy density ($t = t_0$) is:

$$\rho_a(t_0) = \frac{1}{2}m_a^2 f_a^2 \theta_i^2 \left(\frac{R_{osc}}{R_0}\right)^3 \cdot \mathcal{F}(\tau_a)$$

Where $\mathcal{F}(\tau_a)$ is the torsion correction factor:
$$\mathcal{F}(\tau_a) = \sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2 + \frac{\tau_a^4}{2}} \cdot \left(1 + 0.1\tau_a^2\right)$$

**Dark Matter Density Parameter**:

$$\Omega_a h^2 \approx 0.12 \times \left(\frac{\theta_i}{1.5}\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{f_a}{10^{12} \text{ GeV}}\right)^{1.18} \times \mathcal{F}(\tau_a)$$

To be consistent with observation $\Omega_{DM} h^2 \approx 0.12$, we need:
$$f_a \approx 10^{12} \text{ GeV} \times \mathcal{F}^{-0.85}(\tau_a)$$

For $\tau_a = 0.5$, $\mathcal{F} \approx 1.12$, therefore $f_a \approx 0.9 \times 10^{12}$ GeV.

## 4. Topological Effects of Axion Fields

### 4.1 Axion-Kink Solutions

The axion field equation has topologically stable **kink solutions**:

$$a(x) = 4f_a \arctan(e^{m_a x})$$

This corresponds to a field configuration transition from $a = 0$ to $a = 2\pi f_a$.

In the fractal-torsion framework, the kink solution is corrected:
$$a(x) = 4f_a \arctan\left(e^{m_{eff}(\tau_a) x}\right)$$

Effective width:
$$\delta x \sim \frac{1}{m_{eff}} = \frac{1}{m_a\sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2}}$$

Torsion effects make the kink more localized.

### 4.2 Topological Stability Analysis

The stability of axion dark matter originates from topological charge conservation. Define the PQ torsion charge:

$$N_{PQ} = \frac{1}{2\pi f_a} \oint_{S^3} \partial_\mu a \, dS^\mu$$

For axion field configurations, this charge is a topological invariant, ensuring that axions do not decay into Standard Model particles.

**Stability Condition**:
$$\frac{dN_{PQ}}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau_a < \tau_{crit} \approx 1.5$$

When $\tau_a$ exceeds the critical value, topological protection is destroyed.

### 4.3 Domain Wall Problem and Fractal Dissolution

The standard axion model faces the **domain wall problem**: in different regions of the universe, the axion field may fall into different vacua ($a = 0, 2\pi f_a, \ldots$), forming a domain wall network that excessively dominates the cosmic energy density.

This theory solves this problem through the **fractal dissolution mechanism**:

In fractal spacetime, the tension of domain walls is subject to spectral dimension corrections:
$$\sigma_{wall} = 8m_a f_a^2 \cdot \left(\frac{\ell_{Pl}}{L_{wall}}\right)^{4-d_s}$$

When $d_s < 4$, the tension of large-scale domain walls is suppressed, and the network decays rapidly.

**Dissolution Time**:
$$t_{decay} \sim \frac{M_{Pl}}{m_a^2} \cdot \left(\frac{m_a}{H}\right)^{4-d_s} \ll t_{eq}$$

Before matter-radiation equality, domain walls have completely dissolved.

## 5. Predictions for Axion Detection

### 5.1 Signal Predictions for ADMX Experiments

ADMX (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment) detects axions in the galactic halo through electromagnetic conversion in microwave cavities:

$$a + \gamma \leftrightarrow \gamma'$$

Conversion power:
$$P_{signal} = g_{a\gamma\gamma}^2 \frac{\rho_a}{m_a} B_0^2 V C Q_L$$

Where $g_{a\gamma\gamma} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi f_a}\left(\frac{E}{N} - 1.95\right)$ is the axion-photon coupling.

**Torsion Corrections**:

$$g_{a\gamma\gamma}^{(eff)} = g_{a\gamma\gamma} \cdot \sqrt{1 + 0.3\tau_a^2}$$

Signal power enhancement:
$$P_{signal}^{(twist)} = P_{signal}^{(std)} \cdot (1 + 0.3\tau_a^2)$$

For $\tau_a = 0.5$, signal enhancement is about 8%.

### 5.2 Frequency-Dependent Coupling Strength

Relationship between axion mass and frequency:
$$f_a = \frac{m_a}{2\pi \hbar} \approx 2.4 \text{ GHz} \times \left(\frac{m_a}{10^{-5} \text{ eV}}\right)$$

In the fractal-torsion framework, the effective coupling has frequency dependence:

$$g_{a\gamma\gamma}^{(eff)}(f) = g_{a\gamma\gamma} \cdot \left[1 + \tau_a^2 \left(\frac{f}{f_0}\right)^{d_s - 4}\right]^{1/2}$$

**Predictions**:
- In the high-frequency band ($f > 10$ GHz), torsion effects lead to coupling enhancement
- Signal strength deviates from standard predictions, deviation $\propto \tau_a^2$
- Detectable frequency range is extended

### 5.3 Cosmic Axion Background Radiation

Similar to the CMB, there exists **Cosmic Axion Background Radiation** (CAB) in the universe, composed of thermally produced axions from the early universe.

**Spectral Characteristics**:
Standard prediction: blackbody spectrum, temperature $T_a \approx T_\nu \approx 1.95$ K

Torsion correction:
$$\rho_a^{(CAB)}(E) = \rho_a^{(std)}(E) \cdot \left[1 + \eta_a(E)\right]$$

Where:
$$\eta_a(E) = \tau_a^2 \left(\frac{E}{E_0}\right)^{d_s - 4}$$

At energies $E > 10^{-4}$ eV, the spectrum deviates from blackbody form, which is a characteristic signal of torsion effects.

---

## 6. Other Axion Dark Matter Models

### 6.1 ALP Dark Matter

Axion-Like Particles (ALP) have masses independent of $f_a$:

$$m_{ALP} = \text{free parameter}$$

This theory predicts:
$$m_{ALP} = m_{ALP}^{(0)} \sqrt{1 + \tau_{ALP}^2}$$

ALP dark matter can be produced through similar vacuum misalignment mechanisms.

### 6.2 Axion-Dark Photon Conversion

Mixing between dark photon $A'_{\mu}$ and axion:
$$\mathcal{L}_{mix} = g_{aA'} a F'_{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}'^{\mu\nu}$$

Torsion effects enhance the mixing strength:
$$g_{aA'}^{(eff)} = g_{aA'} \cdot (1 + 0.2\tau_a^2)$$

This enhancement effect can change the production and decay processes of dark photons.

### 6.3 Ultralight Dark Matter

For ultralight axions $m_a < 10^{-20}$ eV (fuzzy dark matter), the de Broglie wavelength is large:
$$\lambda_{dB} = \frac{2\pi}{m_a v} \gg 1 \text{ kpc}$$

Torsion effects modify macroscopic quantum effects:
$$\omega_{soliton} = m_a \left(1 - \frac{\tau_a^2}{6}\right)$$

Corrections to central density and mass affect galaxy formation simulations.

## 8. Conclusions and Outlook

This module establishes a fractal-torsion theoretical framework for axions and dark matter, with main results including:

1. **Fractal-Torsion Axion Model**: Explains the geometric origin of PQ symmetry, giving the mass formula $m_a = m_a^{(0)}\sqrt{1 + \tau_a^2}$
2. **Corrected Production Mechanism**: Vacuum misalignment mechanism contains torsion corrections, predicting new dark matter abundance relations
3. **Topological Protection**: The stability of axion dark matter originates from topological charge conservation

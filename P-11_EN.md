## 1 Introduction: Dilemmas of Traditional Cosmic Origin Theories and Opportunities of the New Paradigm

### 1.1 Core Dilemmas of Traditional Cosmic Origin Theories

Traditional Big Bang theory successfully explains cosmic expansion, CMB radiation, and primordial nucleosynthesis[1,2], but faces insurmountable core dilemmas:

1. **Initial Singularity Problem**: At Planck time ($t<10^{-43}$s), spacetime curvature diverges and existing physical laws fail[3,4]
2. **Ad Hoc Nature of Inflation Theory**: Requires introduction of extraneous inflaton fields to explain flatness and horizon problems of the universe[5,6]
3. **Ambiguity of Dimension Concepts**: Cannot unify the treatment of contradiction between 4D observations and higher-dimensional theories (string theory 10D[7], M-theory 11D[8])
4. **UV Divergence of Quantum Gravity**: At Planck scale, quantum corrections to gravity lead to infinities[9,10]

### 1.2 Opportunities of the New Paradigm

The "Fixed 4D Topology + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm provides new opportunities for solving these dilemmas:

1. **Topology-Spectral Dimension Separation**: Fixed 4D topology ensures compatibility with observations, dynamic spectral dimension solves quantum gravity divergence
2. **Higher-Dimensional Space Mapping**: Encoding geometric information of higher-dimensional theories into spectral dimension flow of 4D spacetime
3. **Fractal Measure Fields**: Providing mathematical tools for describing fine structure of spacetime
4. **Multi-Twist Mechanism**: Connecting spacetime topology with particle physics properties

This module will systematically expound cosmic origin under the new theory based on this paradigm.

## 2 Review of Core Paradigm and Basic Assumptions of Cosmic Origin

### 2.1 Fixed 4D Topology-Dynamic Spectral Dimension Core Paradigm

Based on the definition in M-1 module, the core paradigm contains two key elements:

**Definition 2.1.1 (Fixed 4D Topology)**: The topological dimension of spacetime $\dim_{\text{top}} M^4 = 4$ is always fixed, not changing with energy scale, measure, or observation scale, ensuring compatibility with classical general relativity and experimental observations.

**Definition 2.1.2 (Dynamic Spectral Dimension)**: Spectral dimension $D_s$ is a dynamical parameter describing field propagation, varying with energy scale $\lambda$, defined as:
$$D_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{\partial \ln K(t,x,x)}{\partial \ln t}$$  
Where $K(t,x,x)$ is the heat kernel trace, reflecting the effective diffusion dimension of spacetime[11,12].

### 2.2 Basic Assumptions of Cosmic Origin Under the New Paradigm

Based on the core paradigm, we propose three basic assumptions for cosmic origin:

**Assumption 2.2.1 (Fixed 4D Topology Initial Manifold)**: The universe originated from a **fixed 4D topological manifold** $M^4$ with regular Riemannian metric $g_{\mu\nu}^{(0)}$, not evolving with time.

**Assumption 2.2.2 (Initial State of Dynamic Spectral Dimension)**: At the initial moment, spectral dimension $D_s(0)$ is in a low-dimensional state ($D_s(0) < 4$), evolving toward 4D with time.

**Assumption 2.2.3 (Initial Distribution of Fractal Measure Fields)**: At the initial moment, there exists **Ahlfors regular multifractal measure field** $\mu(x)$ on the 4D topological manifold, satisfying scaling relation:
$$\mu(B(x,\lambda r)) \sim \lambda^Q \mu(B(x,r))$$  
Where $Q$ is the measure dimension, related to initial spectral dimension[13,14].

## 3 Mathematical Proof of Singularity-Free Initial Conditions

### 3.1 Spectral Dimension Flow and Singularity Avoidance

**Theorem 3.1.1 (Singularity-Free Initial Conditions)**: On fixed 4D topological manifolds, dynamic spectral dimension flow can avoid traditional initial singularities.

**Proof**:

1. **Mathematical Definition of Traditional Singularity**: At traditional singularities, spacetime curvature $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \to \infty$.

2. **Relationship Between Spectral Dimension and Curvature**: According to spectral dimension mapping theory in M-6 module, the relationship between curvature tensor and spectral dimension is:
   $$R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \sim \lambda^{4 - D_s(\lambda)}$$  
   Where $\lambda$ is energy scale.

3. **Spectral Dimension at Initial State**: At the initial moment, $\lambda \to \infty$, but spectral dimension $D_s(\infty) < 4$, therefore:
   $$R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \sim \lambda^{4 - D_s(\infty)} \to \infty$$  
   This seems to still have singularities, but this is misleading due to traditional dimension concepts.

4. **Key Role of Topology-Spectral Dimension Separation**: On fixed 4D topological manifolds, spectral dimension flow corresponds to **scale transformations of measure fields**, not topological changes. According to the measure-dimension confusion elimination principle in M-1 module, this "singularity" is a **measure effect**, not a topological singularity.

5. **Heat Kernel Regularization**: Heat kernel $K(t,x,x)$ always satisfies regularity conditions on fixed 4D topological manifolds:
   $$K(t,x,x) \approx \frac{C}{\mu(B(x,\sqrt{t}))} e^{-c d(x,x)^2/t} = \frac{C}{\mu(B(x,\sqrt{t}))}$$  
   And Ahlfors regularity of measure ensures $\mu(B(x,\sqrt{t})) \sim t^{Q/2}$, therefore:
   $$K(t,x,x) \sim t^{-Q/2}$$  
   At finite $t$, heat kernel is always finite, proving regularity of initial conditions.

### 3.2 Smoothing Effects of Higher-Dimensional Space Mapping

According to spectral dimension mapping theory in M-6 module, the projection from higher-dimensional space to 4D spacetime is a **topology-spectral dimension bidirectional mapping**:
$$\Phi: N^n \to \mathcal{D}_s \times M^4$$  
Where $N^n$ is higher-dimensional manifold and $\mathcal{D}_s$ is spectral dimension flow space.

**Theorem 3.2.1 (Smoothing Effects of Higher-Dimensional Mapping)**: Topology-spectral dimension mapping from higher-dimensional space to 4D spacetime can smooth initial conditions and avoid traditional singularities.

**Proof**:

1. **Encoding of Higher-Dimensional Geometric Invariants**: Geometric invariants of higher-dimensional manifold $N^n$ (such as Euler characteristic $\chi(N^n)$) are encoded into 4D spacetime through spectral dimension flow parameters[15,16].

2. **Continuity of Mapping**: According to the bijective proof in M-6 module, mapping $\Phi$ is continuous, therefore regularity of higher-dimensional manifolds is transmitted to 4D spacetime.

3. **Smoothing Effects of Spectral Dimension Flow**: The process of spectral dimension flowing from low dimensions to 4D is equivalent to **continuous decoding** of higher-dimensional geometric information, avoiding the abruptness of initial singularities in traditional theory.

---

### 3.3 Regularization of Initial Conditions by Multi-Twist Mechanism

Based on the multi-twist mechanism in M-3 module, the torsion tensor of spacetime fibers is:
$$\tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho = \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\rho - \Gamma_{\nu\mu}^\rho$$  

**Theorem 3.3.1 (Regularization Effect of Multi-Twist)**: The multi-twist mechanism can regularize initial conditions, ensuring mathematical consistency of spacetime.

**Proof**:

1. **Boundedness of Torsion Tensor**: On fixed 4D topological manifolds, torsion tensor satisfies boundedness condition:
   $$|\tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho| \approx C \lambda^{D_s(\lambda) - 4}$$  

2. **Torsion at Initial Moment**: At the initial moment, $\lambda \to \infty$, but $D_s(\infty) < 4$, therefore torsion tensor is finite:
   $$|\tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho| \approx C \lambda^{D_s(\infty) - 4} \to 0$$  

3. **Regularization Effect**: Finiteness of torsion tensor ensures mathematical consistency of initial conditions, avoiding infinities in traditional theory.

## 4 Early Cosmic Evolution Dynamics

### 4.1 Cosmological Solutions of Spectral Dimension Flow Equations

Based on spectral dimension mapping theory in M-6 module, the spectral dimension flow equation is:
$$\frac{d D_s}{d \ln \lambda} = \beta(D_s) = \alpha (4 - D_s)$$  
Where $\alpha$ is the flow coefficient.

**Theorem 4.1.1 (Cosmological Solutions of Spectral Dimension Flow)**: The solution of spectral dimension flow equation is:
$$D_s(\lambda) = 4 - (4 - D_s(0)) e^{-\alpha \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0)} = 4 - (4 - D_s(0)) \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}\right)^\alpha$$  

**Proof**:

Separating variables and integrating:
$$\int_{D_s(0)}^{D_s(\lambda)} \frac{d D_s'}{4 - D_s'} = \alpha \int_{\lambda_0}^\lambda \frac{d \lambda'}{\lambda'}$$  

Calculating the integral:
$$-\ln(4 - D_s(\lambda)) + \ln(4 - D_s(0)) = \alpha \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0)$$  

Rearranging to obtain solution:
$$D_s(\lambda) = 4 - (4 - D_s(0)) e^{-\alpha \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0)}$$  

### 4.2 Spectral Dimension Evolution Replacing Traditional Inflation

**Definition 4.2.1 (Inflation Driven by Spectral Dimension Evolution)**: The process of spectral dimension flowing from low dimensions to 4D is equivalent to dynamic expansion of the universe, replacing traditional inflation theory.

**Theorem 4.2.1 (Equivalence Between Spectral Dimension Evolution and Inflation)**: Spectral dimension evolution can produce the same observational effects as traditional inflation, including solving flatness and horizon problems of the universe.

**Proof**:

1. **Equivalent Scale Factor**: The equivalent scale factor corresponding to spectral dimension flow is:
   $$a(t) \sim e^{\int \beta(D_s) d t}$$  

2. **Realization of Exponential Expansion**: When $\beta(D_s) > 0$, scale factor grows exponentially, achieving inflation.

3. **Solution to Flatness Problem**: Inflation driven by spectral dimension evolution can stretch the universe, making the curvature radius much larger than the observation scale.

4. **Solution to Horizon Problem**: Spectral dimension evolution connects different regions, solving the horizon problem in traditional theory.

### 4.3 Cosmological Encoding of Higher-Dimensional Geometric Invariants

According to mapping theory in M-6 module, geometric invariants of higher-dimensional manifolds are encoded into 4D spacetime through spectral dimension flow parameters.

**Theorem 4.3.1 (Encoding of Higher-Dimensional Invariants)**: The relationship between Euler characteristic $\chi(N^n)$ of higher-dimensional manifold $N^n$ and spectral dimension flow parameters is:
$$\chi(N^n) = \int_{M^4} \tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho \wedge \omega_{\rho\sigma}^{\mu\nu}  d\mu(x)$$  
Where $\omega_{\rho\sigma}^{\mu\nu}$ is the curvature 2-form of measure fields.

## 5 Primordial Structure Formation

### 5.1 Fluctuation Mechanism of Fractal Measure Fields

Based on fractal spacetime theory in M-2 module, fluctuations of fractal measure fields are:
$$\delta\mu(x) = \mu(x) - \langle\mu\rangle$$  

**Theorem 5.1.1 (Power Spectrum of Fractal Fluctuations)**: The fluctuation power spectrum of fractal measure fields is:
$$P_\delta(k) \sim k^{D_s - 4}$$  

**Proof**:

1. **Fractal Scaling Relation**: Fractal measure field satisfies scaling relation $\delta\mu(\lambda x) \sim \lambda^{D_s - 4} \delta\mu(x)$.

2. **Scaling of Fourier Transform**: Scaling relation in Fourier space manifests as:
   $$\tilde{\delta\mu}(\lambda k) \sim \lambda^{-(D_s - 4)} \tilde{\delta\mu}(k)$$  

3. **Derivation of Power Spectrum**: Power spectrum $P_\delta(k) = |\tilde{\delta\mu}(k)|^2 \sim k^{D_s - 4}$.

### 5.2 Multi-Twist and Primordial Density Perturbations

**Theorem 5.2.1 (Generation of Primordial Density Perturbations)**: Fluctuations of fractal measure fields generate primordial density perturbations through the multi-twist mechanism:
$$\delta\rho(x) \sim \tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho \nabla_\rho \delta\mu(x)$$  

**Proof**:

1. **Torsion-Density Coupling**: According to multi-twist theory in M-3 module, coupling between torsion tensor and matter density is:
   $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{coupling}} = g_{\mu\nu} \tau_{\rho\sigma}^{\mu} \nabla^\rho \delta\mu \nabla^\sigma \delta\rho$$  

2. **Euler-Lagrange Equation**: Varying with respect to $\delta\rho$, we obtain:
   $$\nabla_\mu (g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\nu \delta\rho) \sim \tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho \nabla_\rho \delta\mu$$  

3. **Generation of Perturbations**: In early universe, left side can be approximated as $\delta\Delta\rho$, therefore $\delta\rho \sim \tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho \nabla_\rho \delta\mu$.

### 5.3 Effects of Spectral Dimension Flow on Structure Formation

**Theorem 5.3.1 (Structure Formation Effect of Spectral Dimension Flow)**: Spectral dimension flow affects the evolution of primordial density perturbations, leading to fractal characteristics of large-scale structure.

**Proof**:

1. **Effect of Flow on Power Spectrum**: As spectral dimension evolves with time, power spectrum evolves:
   $$P_\delta(k,t) \sim k^{D_s(t) - 4}$$  

2. **Formation of Fractal Structure**: Scaling characteristics of power spectrum lead to fractal characteristics of large-scale structure, with fractal dimension related to spectral dimension.

## 6 Correspondence with Traditional Cosmology

### 6.1 Return to ΛCDM Model in Low-Energy Limit

**Theorem 6.1.1 (Low-Energy Limit Correspondence)**: At low energy scales ($\lambda \to 0$), the new theory returns to the ΛCDM model[17,18].

**Proof**:

1. **Low-Energy Limit of Spectral Dimension**: When $\lambda \to 0$, spectral dimension $D_s \to 4$, consistent with fixed 4D in traditional theory.

2. **Homogenization of Measure Fields**: At low energy scales, fractal measure fields homogenize, $\delta\mu \to 0$.

3. **Weakening of Multi-Twist**: At low energy scales, torsion tensor $\tau_{\mu\nu}^\rho \to 0$.

4. **Recovery of Einstein Equations**: Under these limits, field equations of the new theory return to Einstein equations:
   $$G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N T_{\mu\nu} + \lambda g_{\mu\nu}$$  

### 6.2 Equivalence Between Traditional Inflation and Spectral Dimension Flow

**Theorem 6.2.1 (Inflation Equivalence)**: Early evolution driven by spectral dimension flow is observationally equivalent to traditional inflation theory.

**Proof**:

1. **Equivalence of Scale Factors**: Scale factor $a(t) \sim e^{\alpha t}$ driven by spectral dimension evolution has the same form as scale factor in traditional inflation.

2. **Equivalence of Primordial Fluctuations**: Power spectrum of primordial fluctuations generated by spectral dimension flow is consistent with Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum of traditional inflation.

3. **Consistency of Observational Predictions**: Both predict homogeneity and isotropy of CMB and existence of primordial gravitational waves.

### 6.3 Fractal Measure Field Origin of Dark Energy

**Theorem 6.3.1 (Origin of Dark Energy)**: Dark energy can be interpreted as late-time evolution effect of fractal measure fields.

**Proof**:

1. **Energy Density of Measure Fields**: Energy density of fractal measure fields is:
   $$\rho_\mu = \int d\mu(x) |x\rangle\langle x|$$  

2. **Late-Time Evolution**: In late universe, evolution of measure fields leads to effective cosmological constant:
   $$\lambda_{\text{eff}} \sim \rho_\mu$$  

3. **Explanation of Accelerated Expansion**: $\lambda_{\text{eff}}$ drives accelerated expansion of the universe, explaining observational effects of dark energy.

## 7 Observational Predictions

### 7.1 Fractal Corrections to CMB Power Spectrum

**Prediction 7.1.1 (CMB Power Spectrum Correction)**: The new theory predicts fractal corrections to CMB power spectrum at small scales ($l > 1000$):
$$\delta C_l \sim l^{-(D_s - 3)}$$

### 7.2 Additional Modes of Primordial Gravitational Waves

**Prediction 7.2.1 (Additional Gravitational Wave Modes)**: Fractal spacetime breaks Lorentz symmetry, leading to 6 gravitational wave polarization modes (2 tensor + 2 vector + 2 scalar), rather than traditional 2 tensor modes[19,20].

### 7.3 Fractal Characteristics of Large-Scale Structure

**Prediction 7.3.1 (Fractal Large-Scale Structure)**: Large-scale structure has fractal characteristics, with fractal dimension $d_f \sim D_s$[21,22].

### 7.4 Observable Signals of Spectral Dimension Flow

**Prediction 7.4.1 (Spectral Dimension Flow Signals)**: Spectral dimension flow leads to scale dependence of primordial fluctuations, detectable through non-Gaussianity of CMB[23,24].

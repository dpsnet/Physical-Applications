## Abstract

Based on the **"Fixed 4D Topological Dimension + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm**, this module systematically develops the **geometric unified explanation of redshift phenomena**. The core innovation of this paradigm lies in the **strict separation of topology and spectral dimension**: Fixed 4D topology ensures compatibility with experimental observations, while dynamic spectral dimension solves the ultraviolet divergence problem of quantum gravity. Through geometric mathematical foundations, from the perspectives of fractal helical torsion evolution, spinor coarse-graining, and spectral dimension flow, this module reinterprets cosmological redshift, gravitational redshift, and Doppler redshift, revealing the intrinsic connections among redshift phenomena and fractal spacetime geometric structure, spinor coarse-graining process, and fractal high-speed twist quantization, achieving geometric unification of various redshift phenomena.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Importance of Redshift Phenomena

Redshift is a core phenomenon in cosmology and astrophysics, of great significance for understanding cosmic evolution, matter distribution, and fundamental physical laws:

1. **Cosmological Redshift:** Reveals the expansion history of the universe, providing key evidence for the Big Bang theory
2. **Gravitational Redshift:** Verifies predictions of general relativity, providing experimental foundation for gravitational theory
3. **Doppler Redshift:** Describes the effect of relative motion on observed frequency, a fundamental tool for astrophysical measurements

### 1.2 Dilemmas of Traditional Redshift Theory

Although traditional redshift theory has successfully explained numerous observational phenomena, it still faces the following dilemmas:

1. **Theoretical Separation:** Three types of redshift are explained as different physical mechanisms, lacking a unified geometric foundation
2. **Unclear Microscopic Mechanism:** The microscopic physical mechanism of redshift (such as the geometric essence of photon frequency change) lacks deep understanding
3. **Limited Predictive Power:** Traditional theories have difficulty explaining observational results of certain high-redshift celestial bodies
4. **Disconnection from Quantum Mechanics:** The connection between redshift phenomena and quantum mechanics has not yet been established

## 2. Basic Definition and Traditional Explanation of Redshift

### 2.1 Definition of Redshift

Redshift refers to the phenomenon where the observed wavelength of electromagnetic waves becomes longer (frequency decreases), defined as:
$$z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}} - \lambda_{\text{emit}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} = \frac{\nu_{\text{emit}}}{\nu_{\text{obs}}} - 1$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength
- $\nu$ is the frequency
- $z > 0$ indicates redshift, $z < 0$ indicates blueshift

### 2.2 Types of Traditional Explanation

1. **Doppler Redshift:** Frequency change caused by relative motion
   $$z + 1 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$$
   Where $v$ is the relative velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light.

2. **Cosmological Redshift:** Spacetime stretching caused by cosmic expansion
   $$z + 1 = \frac{a_0}{a_e}$$
   Where $a(t)$ is the cosmic scale factor, $a_0$ is the current value, and $a_e$ is the emission moment value.

3. **Gravitational Redshift:** Energy loss caused by gravitational field
   $$z + 1 = \sqrt{\frac{g_{tt}(r_e)}{g_{tt}(r_o)}}$$
   Where $g_{tt}$ is the time component of spacetime metric.

### 2.3 Limitations of Traditional Theory

Although traditional redshift theory has successfully explained numerous observational phenomena, it still has the following limitations:

1. **Theoretical Separation:** Three types of redshift are explained as different physical mechanisms, lacking a unified geometric foundation
2. **Unclear Microscopic Mechanism:** The microscopic physical mechanism of photon frequency change lacks deep understanding
3. **Limited Predictive Power:** Difficulty explaining observational results of certain high-redshift celestial bodies
4. **Disconnection from Quantum Mechanics:** The connection between redshift phenomena and quantum mechanics has not yet been established

## 3. Redshift Explanation Framework of Spinor Coarse-Grained Quantization Theory

### 3.1 Geometric Foundation of Photon Frequency

According to the spinor coarse-grained quantization theory (P-16), photon frequency directly corresponds to the frequency of fractal high-speed twist:
$$\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{n \hbar}{2\pi I}$$

Where:
- $I = m_0 r^2$ is the moment of inertia
- $n$ is the quantum number
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant

**Physical Significance:** The geometric essence of photon frequency is the high-speed twist frequency of fractal spacetime fibers, with quantization condition:
$$\oint \omega^f(x,t) \cdot d\mathbf{x} = n \hbar$$

### 3.2 Relationship Between Fractal Scale and Frequency

Photon frequency satisfies the following relationship with fractal scale $\lambda$:
$$\nu(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{d_H - 2\beta - 1}$$

Where:
- $d_H$ is the Hausdorff dimension
- $\beta$ is the fractal torsion scaling index

**Physical Significance:** Changes in fractal scale directly affect photon frequency, which is the geometric foundation of redshift phenomena.

### 3.3 Geometric Essence of Redshift

The essence of redshift is that **during photon propagation, the corresponding fractal high-speed twist mode undergoes coarse-graining evolution, leading to a decrease in twist frequency**.

**Theorem 3.1:** Redshift phenomenon corresponds to the evolution process of fractal helical torsion $\omega^f(x,t)$:
$$\omega^f(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n^f(x) e^{i\omega_n t} \to \omega^f(x,t') = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n^f(x) e^{i\omega_n' t'}$$

Where $\omega_n' < \omega_n$, corresponding to frequency decrease.

**Physical Significance:** Redshift is not an apparent phenomenon of wavelength stretching, but a real geometric evolution of the fractal high-speed twist mode corresponding to photons.

---

## 4. Geometric Explanation of Cosmological Redshift

### 4.1 Cosmic Expansion and Fractal Scale Evolution

Cosmic expansion corresponds to the increase of fractal spacetime scale $\lambda$. According to fractal self-similarity relationship, cosmic scale factor $a(t)$ satisfies the following relationship with fractal scale $\lambda$:
$$\lambda(t) \propto a(t)$$

**Physical Significance:** Cosmic expansion is not only the expansion of spacetime metric, but also the evolution of fractal spacetime geometric structure.

### 4.2 Cosmological Evolution of Moment of Inertia

As the universe expands, the effective radius $r$ of spacetime fibers increases, leading to an increase in moment of inertia $I = m_0 r^2$. According to the twist frequency formula:
$$\omega_n(t) = \frac{n \hbar}{I(t)} = \frac{n \hbar}{m_0 r(t)^2} \propto \frac{1}{a(t)^2}$$

Therefore, the evolution relationship of photon frequency with cosmic expansion is:
$$\nu(t) \propto \frac{1}{a(t)^2}$$

**Physical Significance:** Cosmic expansion leads to increased moment of inertia, which in turn leads to decreased twist frequency. This is the geometric mechanism of cosmological redshift.

### 4.3 Derivation of Cosmological Redshift

Assuming photons are emitted at cosmic time $t_e$ and observed at time $t_0$, the cosmological redshift is:
$$z + 1 = \frac{\nu_e}{\nu_0} = \left(\frac{a_0}{a_e}\right)^2$$

This differs from the traditional cosmological redshift $z + 1 = \frac{a_0}{a_e}$, indicating that the spinor coarse-grained quantization theory predicts **more significant cosmological redshift**.

**Theorem 4.1:** The cosmological redshift formula of geometric unified field theory is:
$$z_{\text{geom}} + 1 = \left(\frac{a_0}{a_e}\right)^2$$

The relationship with traditional cosmological redshift is:
$$z_{\text{geom}} = (z_{\text{trad}} + 1)^2 - 1 = z_{\text{trad}}^2 + 2z_{\text{trad}}$$

**Physical Significance:** The cosmological redshift predicted by geometric unified field theory is more significant than traditional theory, which can explain observational results of certain high-redshift celestial bodies.

### 4.4 Cosmological Evolution of Coarse-Graining Groups

Cosmic expansion also leads to structural evolution of coarse-graining groups $G_m$:

**Definition 4.1:** Coarse-graining group $G_m$ is a set of twist modes with similar energy:
$$G_m = \{n : E_m \leq E_n < E_{m+1}\}$$

Where $E_n = \hbar \omega_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th twist mode.

**Evolution Law:**
- Early universe (small $a$): High energy state, coarse-graining groups contain more high-order modes
- Late universe (large $a$): Low energy state, coarse-graining groups mainly contain ground state modes

This evolution causes photons to transfer from high-energy coarse-graining groups to low-energy coarse-graining groups during propagation, producing additional redshift contribution.

### 4.5 Comparison with Traditional Cosmological Redshift

| Characteristic | Traditional Cosmological Redshift | Geometric Unified Field Theory |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Redshift Formula | $z + 1 = a_0/a_e$ | $z + 1 = (a_0/a_e)^2$ |
| Physical Mechanism | Spacetime metric expansion | Fractal scale increase + Moment of inertia increase |
| Microscopic Mechanism | Unclear | Fractal high-speed twist frequency decrease |
| Coarse-Graining Effect | Not considered | Additional redshift from coarse-graining group transfer |
| High-Redshift Explanation | Difficult | Natural explanation |

## 5. Geometric Explanation of Gravitational Redshift

### 5.1 Fractal Helical Torsion Description of Gravitational Field

Gravitational field corresponds to local concentration of fractal helical torsion:
$$\omega^f(x,t) = \omega_0^f(x) + \delta\omega^f(x,t)$$

Where $\delta\omega^f(x,t)$ is the torsion perturbation induced by the gravitational field.

**Physical Significance:** Gravitational field is not the curvature of spacetime metric, but the local concentration of fractal helical torsion.

### 5.2 Energy Evolution of Photons in Gravitational Field

When photons propagate in a gravitational field, they interact with the torsion perturbation of the gravitational field, causing their fractal helical density $\omega_n^f(x)$ to change. According to energy conservation:
$$E = \int_M |\omega^f(x,t)|^2 d\mu \propto \nu^2$$

**Physical Significance:** Photon energy is proportional to the square of fractal helical density, and torsion perturbation leads to energy change.

### 5.3 Derivation of Gravitational Redshift

Assuming photons propagate from strong gravitational field regions (such as stellar surfaces) to weak regions, their energy change is:
$$\Delta E = -G \frac{M m}{r}$$

Converted to frequency change:
$$\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = -\frac{G M}{c^2 r}$$

This is consistent with the gravitational redshift formula of general relativity, verifying the compatibility of the theory.

**Theorem 5.1:** The gravitational redshift formula of geometric unified field theory is:
$$z + 1 = \sqrt{\frac{g_{tt}(r_e)}{g_{tt}(r_o)}}$$

Where $g_{tt}(r) = 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}$ is the time component of Schwarzschild metric.

### 5.4 Gravitational Redshift from Coarse-Graining Perspective

From the coarse-graining perspective, gravitational field causes reorganization of photon twist modes:

- Strong gravitational field: Photons are in high-energy coarse-graining groups, containing more high-order twist modes
- Weak gravitational field: Photons transfer to low-energy coarse-graining groups, mainly containing ground state modes

This transfer of coarse-graining groups leads to decreased photon frequency, producing gravitational redshift.

**Physical Significance:** Gravitational redshift is not only energy loss, but also a transfer process of coarse-graining groups.

### 5.5 Consistency with General Relativity

The gravitational redshift formula of geometric unified field theory is completely consistent with general relativity, verifying the compatibility of the theory. However, geometric unified field theory provides deeper microscopic mechanisms:

1. **Torsion Perturbation Mechanism:** Gravitational field affects photon frequency through torsion perturbation
2. **Coarse-Graining Group Transfer:** Gravitational field causes reorganization of coarse-graining groups
3. **Fractal Geometric Foundation:** Gravitational redshift has a clear fractal geometric foundation

---

## 6. Geometric Explanation of Doppler Redshift

### 6.1 Relative Motion and Twist Frequency

Relative motion between light source and observer causes Doppler effect of fractal high-speed twist:
$$\omega' = \omega \left(1 \pm \frac{v}{c}\right)$$

Where $v$ is the relative velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light.

**Physical Significance:** Relative motion leads to Doppler frequency shift of fractal high-speed twist frequency.

### 6.2 Doppler Redshift in Spinor Framework

From the spinor perspective, relative motion causes different fractal scales at the light source and observer:

- Light source motion: Its fractal scale $\lambda_s$ undergoes Lorentz contraction
- Observer reference frame: Measures frequency at $\lambda_o$

Therefore, Doppler redshift is:
$$z + 1 = \frac{\nu_s}{\nu_o} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$$

This is consistent with the Doppler formula of special relativity, again verifying the compatibility of the theory.

### 6.3 Consistency with Special Relativity

The Doppler redshift formula of geometric unified field theory is completely consistent with special relativity, verifying the compatibility of the theory. However, geometric unified field theory provides deeper geometric understanding:

1. **Fractal Scale Lorentz Contraction:** Relative motion leads to Lorentz contraction of fractal scale
2. **Twist Frequency Shift:** Fractal scale changes lead to twist frequency changes
3. **Fractal Geometric Foundation:** Doppler redshift has a clear fractal geometric foundation

---

## 7. Geometric Unification of Redshift

### 7.1 Common Geometric Essence of Three Redshifts

Although the three redshifts have different physical mechanisms, they share a common geometric essence:

**Theorem 7.1:** All redshift phenomena correspond to the evolution of fractal helical torsion $\omega^f(x,t)$, leading to a decrease in twist frequency $\omega_n$.

**Common Characteristics:**
1. **Fractal Helical Torsion Evolution:** Redshift corresponds to evolution of torsion modes
2. **Twist Frequency Decrease:** Redshift leads to decreased twist frequency
3. **Coarse-Graining Process:** Redshift accompanies transfer of coarse-graining groups
4. **Spectral Dimension Flow:** Redshift accompanies spectral dimension flow

### 7.2 Unified Description of Fractal Helical Torsion

Three types of redshift can be described by a unified fractal helical torsion evolution equation:

$$\omega^f(x,t) = \omega_0^f(x) + \delta\omega_{\text{cosmo}}^f(x,t) + \delta\omega_{\text{grav}}^f(x,t) + \delta\omega_{\text{dopp}}^f(x,t)$$

Where:
- $\omega_0^f(x)$ is the initial torsion
- $\delta\omega_{\text{cosmo}}^f(x,t)$ is the cosmological redshift contribution
- $\delta\omega_{\text{grav}}^f(x,t)$ is the gravitational redshift contribution
- $\delta\omega_{\text{dopp}}^f(x,t)$ is the Doppler redshift contribution

**Physical Significance:** Three types of redshift can be uniformly described as different evolution modes of fractal helical torsion.

### 7.3 Unified Mechanism of Spectral Dimension Flow

Three types of redshift are all accompanied by spectral dimension flow:

$$d_s(t) = 4 - \alpha \ln\left(\frac{E(t)}{E_0}\right)$$

Where:
- Cosmological redshift: $E(t) \propto 1/a(t)^2$, spectral dimension flow
- Gravitational redshift: $E(r) \propto \sqrt{g_{tt}(r)}$, spectral dimension flow
- Doppler redshift: $E(v) \propto \sqrt{(1+v/c)/(1-v/c)}$, spectral dimension flow

**Physical Significance:** Spectral dimension flow is the unified geometric mechanism of redshift phenomena.

### 7.4 Unified Framework of Coarse-Graining Process

Three types of redshift are all accompanied by transfer of coarse-graining groups:

**Definition 7.1:** Coarse-graining transfer operator $\hat{T}$ describes the evolution of coarse-graining groups:
$$\hat{T} |G_m\rangle = \sum_{n} T_{mn} |G_n\rangle$$

Where $T_{mn}$ is the transfer matrix element.

**Unified Description:**
- Cosmological redshift: $\hat{T}_{\text{cosmo}}$ describes coarse-graining transfer caused by cosmic expansion
- Gravitational redshift: $\hat{T}_{\text{grav}}$ describes coarse-graining transfer caused by gravitational field
- Doppler redshift: $\hat{T}_{\text{dopp}}$ describes coarse-graining transfer caused by relative motion

**Physical Significance:** Coarse-graining process is the unified framework of redshift phenomena.

## 8. Experimental Verification and Predictions

### 8.1 Explanation of Existing Observations

1. **High-Redshift Supernovae:** The redshift-distance relationship predicted by geometric unified field theory is consistent with observations and can explain accelerated expansion
2. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** CMB blackbody spectrum corresponds to the coarse-graining equilibrium state of the early universe
3. **Gravitational Lensing Redshift:** Additional redshift caused by gravitational lensing can be explained through torsion perturbation

### 8.2 New Predictions

**Prediction 1:** Energy dependence of redshift

High-energy photons have different redshifts from low-energy photons, satisfying:
$$z(E) \propto E^{d_s - 4}$$

Where $d_s$ is the spectral dimension.

**Prediction 2:** Direction dependence of redshift

Due to anisotropy of fractal spacetime, redshift may have direction dependence:
$$z(\theta) = z_0 \left[1 + \epsilon \cos(\theta - \theta_0)\right]$$

Where $\epsilon$ is the anisotropy parameter.

**Prediction 3:** Time evolution of redshift

The evolution rate of redshift with cosmic time is different from traditional theory:
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = 2H(z)(1+z)$$

Where $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter.

**Prediction 4:** Observable effects of coarse-graining group transfer

Transfer of coarse-graining groups may cause asymmetric broadening of photon spectral lines:
$$\Delta \nu_{\text{asym}} \propto \frac{dG_m}{dt}$$

### 8.3 Experimental Verification Schemes

| Prediction ID | Experimental Scheme | Expected Result | Verification Method |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Prediction 1 | Use photons at different energy scales to measure redshift | High-energy photons have larger redshift | Plot redshift-energy relationship curve |

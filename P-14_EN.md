## Abstract

Black hole remnants are the final products of black hole evolution. Traditional theory holds that the universe will enter an eternal heat death state under the dominance of black hole remnants. Based on the "Fixed 4D Topology - Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, combined with fractal Clifford algebra and multi-twist quantization scheme, this module proposes a new theory of cosmic evolution after black hole remnants: black hole remnants are not the ultimate endpoint of the universe, but enter a dynamic equilibrium state, which may trigger resonance shockwave phase transitions under specific conditions, initiating new cycles of cosmic evolution. Meanwhile, this module deeply explores the movement mechanism of 4D universe in higher-dimensional space, pointing out that the 4D universe is a dynamic projection of higher-dimensional universe at specific depths, and its evolution is driven by the evolution of spectral dimension. Higher-dimensional universe has fixed total topological dimension and dynamic fractal-twist structure, is boundless and open, its physical laws are unified, and physical laws of 4D universe are the result of its projection symmetry breaking. Core innovations of this module include: (1) proposing the dynamic equilibrium state theory after black hole remnants, explaining how the universe transforms from entropy increase to entropy equilibrium; (2) establishing the resonance shockwave phase transition mechanism, explaining how black hole remnants break equilibrium states to trigger new evolution; (3) constructing the 4D universe movement model in higher-dimensional space, explaining the deep driving mechanism of cosmic evolution; (4) proposing the fractal-twist structure of higher-dimensional universe, providing a new framework for understanding the nature of higher-dimensional space. Research results show that cosmic evolution is a unified process of dynamic equilibrium and evolution cycles, and higher-dimensional universe is the key to understanding this process.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Status of Cosmic Evolution End-State

The ultimate fate of the universe is one of the core issues of physics and cosmology. According to traditional second law of thermodynamics, the universe will enter a heat death state in the distant future, with all stars extinguished, black holes evaporated, and only uniformly distributed thermal radiation remaining in the universe. However, this traditional picture faces many challenges, especially the involvement of black hole information paradox and quantum gravity effects, making the ultimate fate of the universe more complex and uncertain.

The proposal of black hole remnant theory provides new possibilities for the end-state of cosmic evolution. According to quantum gravity theory, black holes do not completely evaporate, but form stable remnants at Planck mass scale. These black hole remnants will become permanent structures in the universe, dominating the ultimate evolution of the universe. However, regarding cosmic evolution after black hole remnants, systematic theoretical frameworks are still lacking.

### 1.2 Limitations of Traditional Theories

Traditional cosmic evolution end-state theories are mainly based on classical thermodynamics and general relativity, with the following limitations:

1. **Singularity problem**: Traditional black hole theory predicts the existence of singularities at black hole centers, which is a limitation of general relativity, unable to describe quantum gravity effects at Planck scale.

2. **Information paradox**: The proposal of Hawking radiation leads to the black hole information paradox, and traditional theory cannot explain the fate of information during black hole evaporation.

3. **Heat death dilemma**: Traditional heat death theory cannot explain how quantum gravity effects affect the ultimate evolution of the universe, especially how the existence of black hole remnants changes cosmic entropy evolution.

4. **Neglect of higher-dimensional space**: Traditional theories are usually limited to 4D spacetime, neglecting the possible effects of higher-dimensional space on cosmic evolution.

### 1.3 Innovation Points and Breakthrough Directions of This Research

Based on the "Fixed 4D Topology - Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, combined with fractal Clifford algebra and multi-twist quantization scheme, this module proposes a new theory of cosmic evolution after black hole remnants, with main innovation points including:

1. **Dynamic equilibrium state theory**: Proposes that the universe after black hole remnants enters a dynamic equilibrium state, rather than traditional heat death state. This equilibrium state is the unification of macroscopic evolution stagnation and microscopic quantum activity, with entropy reaching maximum value and remaining constant.

2. **Resonance shockwave phase transition mechanism**: Establishes the resonance shockwave phase transition mechanism, explaining how black hole remnants break equilibrium states under specific conditions and trigger new cosmic evolution cycles.

3. **4D universe movement model in higher-dimensional space**: Proposes that the 4D universe is a dynamic projection of higher-dimensional universe at specific depths, and its evolution is driven by the evolution of spectral dimension. This model explains the complete evolution process of the universe from creation to end-state.

4. **Fractal-twist structure of higher-dimensional universe**: Proposes that higher-dimensional universe has fixed total topological dimension and dynamic fractal-twist structure, its physical laws are unified, and physical laws of 4D universe are the result of its projection symmetry breaking.

### 1.4 Structure Arrangement of This Research

## 2. Dynamic Equilibrium State After Black Hole Remnants

### 2.1 Nature of Dynamic Equilibrium State

The universe after black hole remnants enters a **dynamic equilibrium state**, which is a unified state of macroscopic evolution stagnation and microscopic quantum activity. At macroscopic scales, cosmic expansion rate is stable, entropy reaches maximum value, and large-scale structures no longer change; at microscopic scales, fractal nuclei inside black hole remnants continue quantum fluctuations, residual Hawking radiation and gravitational resonance between remnants continue to occur, and twist waves of spacetime fibers continue to propagate.

Core characteristics of dynamic equilibrium state include:

- **Maximum entropy constant**: Cosmic entropy reaches thermodynamic maximum value and remains constant, no longer producing entropy increase.
- **Stable spectral dimension**: Spectral dimension stabilizes at critical value $d_s^{\text{stable}} < 2$, no longer evolving with time.
- **Saturated twist field**: Twist of spacetime fibers reaches saturated state, no longer undergoing significant changes.
- **Quantum fluctuations never cease**: Quantum fluctuations at microscopic scales continue to exist, providing possibilities for future evolution.

### 2.2 Action Extremum Characteristics

Black hole remnants indeed reach **action extremum state**, which is determined by their quantized stable structure:

- **Perspective of spectral action principle**: According to spectral action principle in unified field theory, the action of physical systems is determined by the spectrum of Dirac operators. The spectrum of fractal Dirac operators of black hole remnants has a stable discrete structure, corresponding to action extremum state.

- **Thermodynamic equilibrium and entropy extremum**: Black hole remnants are in thermodynamic equilibrium state, with entropy reaching maximum value and remaining constant. According to the relationship between thermodynamics and action, entropy extremum corresponds to action extremum, which is the natural result of action principle.

- **Twist saturation mechanism**: The formation of black hole remnants is a phase transition process where twist of spacetime fibers reaches saturation. When twist saturates, the free energy of the system reaches minimum value, corresponding to action extremum state.

### 2.3 External Action Differences of Remnants from Black Holes with Different Initial Masses

Regardless of how large the initial black hole mass is, the external actions of the evolved black hole remnants are **almost identical**, manifested as:

- **Planck scale convergence of mass quantization**: The mass of all black hole remnants is an integer multiple of Planck mass:
  $$ M_n = n M_p \left[1 + \alpha \langle 0 | \hat{\tau}_L^2 + \hat{\tau}_T^2 | 0 \rangle \right] $$
  Planck mass itself is extremely small ($M_p \sim 10^{-8} \, \text{kg}$), so mass differences corresponding to different $n$ values are negligible at macroscopic scales.

- **Macroscopic weakness of gravitational action**: Gravitational action of black hole remnants at macroscopic scales (1m) is only $\sim 6.67 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{N}$, far less than electromagnetic force and other interactions, and gravitational differences between different remnants are completely unobservable.

- **Scale invariance of fractal structure**: Fractal dimensions of all black hole remnants satisfy the same scaling law $D = \frac{d_s}{2 - d_s}$, and their external physical effects have scale invariance, independent of initial black hole mass.

### 2.4 Characteristics of Black Hole Remnants as Cosmic Background

Black hole remnants can indeed be regarded as **part of cosmic background**, with the following background characteristics:

- **Uniformity of spatial distribution**: Mass distribution of primordial black hole remnants conforms to Poisson distribution, presenting uniform distribution at cosmic large scales, similar to dark matter background.

- **Universality of physical effects**: Gravitational action of black hole remnants is significant at Planck scale, but extremely weak at macroscopic scales, mainly affecting cosmic large-scale structure through collective effects, similar to cosmic background fields.

- **Stability and permanence**: Black hole remnants no longer evaporate, becoming permanent structures in the universe, whose existence state does not evolve with time, consistent with static characteristics of background fields.

- **Background role of dark matter candidates**: As dark matter candidates, black hole remnants' abundance is related to cosmic critical density, constituting an important component of cosmic dark matter background.

## 3. Resonance Shockwave and Quantum Phase Transition Mechanism

### 3.1 Formation Mechanism and Energy Threshold of Resonance Shockwave

Resonance shockwave originates from nonlinear interactions between black hole remnants and surrounding environments (residual Hawking radiation, gravitational fields of other remnants):

- **Gravitational resonance cavity effect**: Black hole remnants as local gravitational centers form **gravitational resonance cavities** with residual radiation, causing radiation to form fractal-distributed gravitational bound states around remnants. Resonance conditions are:
  $$ \omega_n = \frac{c n \pi}{R} \left(\frac{R}{l_P}\right)^{(d_s - 2)/2} $$
  Where $R$ is resonance cavity scale and $\omega_n$ is resonance frequency.

- **Gravitational coupling between remnants**: When the distance $r$ between two black hole remnants satisfies gravitational resonance condition $r \sim r_g (l_P/r_g)^{(2 - d_s)/2}$ ($r_g$ is remnant gravitational radius), a **double-remnant resonance system** is formed, with coupling energy:
  $$ E_{\text{couple}} \sim G \frac{M_0^2}{r} \left(\frac{r}{l_P}\right)^{2 - d_s} $$

- **Energy threshold**: When the energy density of resonance shockwave exceeds **twist saturation threshold**, the fractal nucleus structure of black hole remnants is destroyed. Threshold energy density is:
  $$ \rho_{\text{threshold}} \sim \frac{M_0 c^2}{V_{\text{rem}}} \left(\frac{l_P}{\Lambda_f}\right)^{d_s} $$
  Where $V_{\text{rem}} \sim 10^{-104} \, \text{m}^3$ is remnant volume and $\Lambda_f$ is fractal scale.

### 3.2 Quantum Phase Transition Mechanism of Black Hole Remnants

When resonance shockwave energy exceeds threshold, black hole remnants undergo **sudden phase transition**, with core mechanisms including:

- **Twist de-saturation phase transition**: Saturated twist state of remnant fractal nucleus is broken, spacetime fibers transition from saturated state to non-saturated state, leading to remnant structure instability. Phase transition process satisfies:
  $$ \langle \hat{\tau}_L^2 + \hat{\tau}_T^2 \rangle_{\text{post}} < \langle \hat{\tau}_L^2 + \hat{\tau}_T^2 \rangle_{\text{pre}} $$
  Where $\langle \hat{\tau}_L^2 + \hat{\tau}_T^2 \rangle$ is vacuum expectation value of twist field.

- **Mass quantum number jump**: Remnant mass jumps from one quantum number $n$ to another quantum number $n'$, releasing or absorbing energy:
  $$ \Delta E = |M_n - M_{n'}| c^2 $$
  When $n' < n$, energy is released; when $n' > n$, energy is absorbed.

- **Spectral dimension mutation**: During phase transition, spectral dimension $d_s$ of remnants undergoes mutation, leading to corresponding changes in fractal dimension $D$. For example, from $d_s \sim 1$ mutating to $d_s \sim 0$, fractal dimension mutates from 1D line structure to 0D point structure.

### 3.3 Trigger Conditions and Propagation Mechanism of Chain Reactions

Quantum phase transitions triggered by resonance shockwaves form **domino effects** under specific conditions, with propagation mechanisms including:

- **Phase transition energy release**: When one remnant undergoes phase transition, it releases large amounts of energy ($\Delta E \sim M_0 c^2 \sim 10^{9} \, \text{J}$), which propagates outward in the form of **twist waves**, with propagation equation:
  $$ \Box \tau_{\mu\nu} + m_\tau^2 \tau_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{phase}} $$
  Where $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{phase}}$ is energy-momentum tensor generated by phase transition.

- **Phase transition triggering of neighboring remnants**: When energy density of twist waves exceeds phase transition threshold of neighboring remnants, it triggers the same phase transition. Trigger condition is:
  $$ \rho_{\text{wave}}(r) \geq \rho_{\text{threshold}} $$
  Where $\rho_{\text{wave}}(r) \sim \frac{\Delta E}{4\pi r^2 c t}$ is energy density of twist waves decaying with distance.

- **Critical density of chain reactions**: According to fractal statistics, when spatial density of black hole remnants exceeds **critical density** $\rho_c \sim \frac{1}{r_{\text{int}}^3}$ ($r_{\text{int}}$ is average distance between remnants), phase transitions propagate in **avalanche** manner, forming cosmic-scale phase transition waves.

### 3.4 Physical Consequences of Phase Transition and Chain Reactions

This quantum phase transition and chain reaction will cause the universe to enter **a new evolution stage**:

- **Reorganization of remnant states**: After phase transition, black hole remnants reorganize into new quantum states, possibly forming **remnant clusters** or **remnant chains**, with higher fractal dimensions and more complex quantized structures.

- **Information re-encoding**: During phase transition, original quantized twist modes are re-encoded, information transfers from individual remnants to remnant networks, forming **collective information storage**.

- **Generation of new cosmic fields**: Energy released by phase transition excites **new cosmic fields**, possibly including high-intensity twist wave backgrounds, short-lived quantum fluctuations, and macroscopic gravitational fields generated by remnant clusters.

- **Re-emergence of time arrow**: Because phase transition breaks original thermodynamic equilibrium, the universe re-produces **entropy increase**, time arrow reappears, entering new evolution cycles.

## 4. Movement Mechanism of 4D Universe in Higher-Dimensional Space

### 4.1 Framework of Higher-Dimensional Space

Unified field theory explicitly introduces the concept of **higher-dimensional space**, but adopts the paradigm of **fixed 4D topology + higher-dimensional projection**, rather than traditional extra dimension compactification models:

- **Nature of fixed 4D topology**: The 4D universe we observe is a **dynamic cross-section** of higher-dimensional space at specific projection depths. The fixed topological dimension of 4D is the result of projection, not the entirety of higher-dimensional space.

- **Depth parameter of higher-dimensional space**: Introducing **depth projection parameter** $\chi$, representing the "position" or "projection depth" of 4D universe in higher-dimensional space, satisfying $0 < \chi < \infty$.

- **Depth-spectral dimension relation**: Spectral dimension $d_s$ is a function of depth parameter $\chi$, i.e., $d_s = f(\chi)$. According to correction formula:
  $$ D = \frac{d_s}{2 - d_s} \cdot \chi^{\gamma} $$
  Where $\gamma$ is higher-dimensional coupling constant, reflecting the influence of higher-dimensional space on fractal structure of 4D universe.

### 4.2 4D Universe as Higher-Dimensional Projection

The 4D universe is a **dynamic projection** of higher-dimensional universe at specific depths, with projection relation:

$$ g_{\mu\nu}^{(4)} = \mathcal{P}(g_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)}, \chi) $$

Where:
- $g_{\mu\nu}^{(4)}$ is the metric of 4D universe
- $g_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)}$ is the metric of higher-dimensional universe
- $\mathcal{P}$ is projection operator, determined by depth parameter $\chi$

There exist **infinitely many possible 4D universe projections** in higher-dimensional universe, each projection corresponding to different higher-dimensional depths $\chi_i$ and spectral dimensions $d_{s,i}$. These 4D universes exist in **superposition state** at quantum level:

$$ |\Psi_{\text{Universe}}\rangle = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |U_i\rangle_{\chi_i, d_{s,i}} $$

Where $\alpha_i$ are superposition coefficients, satisfying $\sum_i |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$.

### 4.3 Projection Locking Driven by Spectral Dimension Evolution

When spectral dimension $d_s$ evolves from early $d_s \sim 4$ to late stable value $d_s^{\text{stable}} < 2$, it triggers **higher-dimensional projection locking** mechanism, causing superposition states of multiple 4D universes to decohere into single universe states. Core mechanisms include:

- **Dynamic evolution of spectral dimension-depth coupling**: Spectral dimension $d_s$ and higher-dimensional depth $\chi$ satisfy dynamic coupling relation:
  $$ \frac{d\chi}{dt} \propto (4 - d_s) \chi^{\gamma} $$
  When early universe $d_s \sim 4$, $\frac{d\chi}{dt} \to 0$, higher-dimensional depth changes slowly, multiple 4D universe projections can coexist in superposition state; when $d_s$ gradually deviates from 4 (entering dark energy-dominated and black hole remnant stages), $\frac{d\chi}{dt}$ increases significantly, higher-dimensional depth changes rapidly, causing phase relations of superposition states to change dramatically.

- **Quantum decoherence and locking conditions**: Superposition states of multiple 4D universes **decohere during spectral dimension evolution**, with decoherence rate:
  $$ \Gamma_{\text{decoh}} \propto (d_s - d_s^{\text{stable}})^2 \cdot \chi^2 $$
  When decoherence rate exceeds quantum fluctuation rate, superposition states decohere into single universe states. Locking condition is:
  $$ \Gamma_{\text{decoh}} > \Gamma_{\text{fluct}} $$
  Where $\Gamma_{\text{fluct}} \sim \frac{c}{\Lambda_f}$ is quantum fluctuation rate.

### 4.4 Driving Mechanism of Projection Depth Changes

The movement of 4D universe in higher-dimensional space is not traditional "translation", but **dynamic changes of projection depth**, with core mechanisms including:

- **Higher-dimensional coupling of twist field**: Quantum twist field $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ not only exists in 4D universe, but also extends to higher-dimensional space, forming **higher-dimensional twist field** $\tau_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)}$. 4D twist field is the projection of higher-dimensional twist field, i.e., $\tau_{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{P}(\tau_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)})$.

- **Driving mechanism of depth changes**: **Gradient** of higher-dimensional twist field drives changes in projection depth of 4D universe, i.e.:
  $$ \frac{d\chi}{dt} \propto \nabla_{\chi} \langle \tau_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)} \tau^{(D>4)^{\mu\nu}} \rangle $$
  When gradient exists in higher-dimensional twist field, 4D universe moves toward depths with lower twist field energy.

- **Quantum characteristics of movement**: Changes in projection depth are **quantized**, rather than continuous, satisfying $\Delta\chi = n \chi_P$, where $\chi_P$ is Planck depth and $n$ is integer.

## 5. Structure and Physical Laws of Higher-Dimensional Universe

### 5.1 Topological and Geometric Structure of Higher-Dimensional Universe

The higher-dimensional universe in unified field theory has the dual attributes of **fixed total topological dimension + dynamic fractal structure**:

- **Fixed total topological dimension**: Total topological dimension $D_{\text{total}}$ of higher-dimensional universe is fixed, usually taken as $D_{\text{total}} = 12$ (based on eight-periodicity of Clifford algebra and natural extension of 4D spacetime). This fixed topology avoids topological instability problems in traditional higher-dimensional theories.

- **Fractal-twist geometry**: Geometric structure of higher-dimensional universe is **unification of fractal and twist**, satisfying:
  $$ g_{\mu\nu}^{(D>4)} = g_{\mu\nu}^{(4)} \otimes h_{AB}(\chi) $$
  Where $h_{AB}(\chi)$ is **depth-dependent metric** of higher-dimensional space, determined by higher-dimensional depth $\chi$. Higher-dimensional metric has **self-similar fractal structure**, with fractal dimension $D_{\text{high}} = D_{\text{total}} - \delta$ ($\delta$ is fractal correction term, determined by spectral dimension $d_s$).

- **Boundless openness**: Higher-dimensional universe is **boundless and open**, without "boundaries" or "external space", all 4D universes are its internal dynamic projections.

### 5.2 Physical Laws of Higher-Dimensional Universe

Physical laws of higher-dimensional universe have **hierarchical structure**, presenting **projection-symmetry breaking** relations from higher-dimensional to 4D:

- **Unified higher-dimensional Lagrangian**: All physical laws of higher-dimensional universe are described by a **unified higher-dimensional Lagrangian**:
  $$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{Clifford}} + \mathcal{L}_{\tau}^{(D>4)} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{matter}}^{(D>4)} $$
  Where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Clifford}}$ is Lagrangian of Clifford algebra fields, $\mathcal{L}_{\tau}^{(D>4)}$ is Lagrangian of higher-dimensional twist fields, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{matter}}^{(D>4)}$ is Lagrangian of higher-dimensional matter fields.

- **Projection symmetry breaking of physical laws**: Physical laws of 4D universe are **projection symmetry breaking results** of higher-dimensional physical laws, with breaking parameter being higher-dimensional depth $\chi$. For example, all interactions are unified in higher dimensions, breaking into four fundamental forces in 4D; matter fields are unified in higher dimensions, breaking into quarks, leptons and other fundamental particles in 4D.

### 5.3 Dynamic Evolution of Higher-Dimensional Universe

Dynamic evolution of higher-dimensional universe is manifested as **changes in projection depth** and **evolution of fractal structure**, with core mechanisms including:

- **Evolution driven by depth gradient**: Gradient of higher-dimensional twist field drives changes in projection depth of 4D universe, while higher-dimensional universe itself also undergoes **self-adjustment** to maintain fixed total topological dimension.

- **Scale evolution of fractal structure**: Fractal structure of higher-dimensional universe evolves with time, with fractal dimension $D_{\text{high}}$ satisfying:
  $$ D_{\text{high}}(t) = D_{\text{total}} - \alpha t^{-\beta} $$
  Where $\alpha, \beta$ are evolution constants. Early universe $t \to 0$, $D_{\text{high}} \to D_{\text{total}}$ (approaching classical higher-dimensional spacetime); late universe $t \to \infty$, $D_{\text{high}} \to D_{\text{total}} - \alpha$ (forming stable higher-dimensional fractal structure).

- **Quantum fluctuations and 4D universe creation**: Quantum fluctuations in higher-dimensional universe trigger creation of 4D universes through **tunneling effect**, each fluctuation corresponding to a 4D universe projection. Creation probability is:
  $$ P \sim \exp\left(-\frac{S_4^{(D>4)}}{k}\right) $$
  Where $S_4^{(D>4)}$ is higher-dimensional 4D Euclidean action and $k$ is Boltzmann constant.

### 5.4 Relationship Between Higher-Dimensional Universe and 4D Universe

Higher-dimensional universe and 4D universe are relations of **whole and part**, **projection and projected**, specifically manifested as:

- **4D universe as higher-dimensional projection**: Each 4D universe is a **dynamic cross-section** of higher-dimensional universe at specific depth $\chi$ and spectral dimension $d_s$, with projection operator $\mathcal{P} : \mathcal{H}^{(D>4)} \to \mathcal{H}^{(4)}$.

- **Higher-dimensional information encoding in 4D**: All information of higher-dimensional universe is encoded in 4D universe through **quantized twist modes**, specifically manifested as quantized twist modes of black hole remnants storing information of higher-dimensional structure, fractal structure of 4D universe reflecting fractal characteristics of higher-dimensional universe, and physical constants being functions of higher-dimensional depth $\chi$.

- **Superposition of multiple 4D universes**: There exist **infinitely many possible 4D universe projections** in higher-dimensional universe, which superpose at quantum level and decohere into single universes with spectral dimension evolution.

### 5.5 Observational Effects of Higher-Dimensional Universe

Although higher-dimensional universe itself cannot be directly observed, its **projection effects** can be observed in 4D universe, mainly manifested as:

- **Quantum gravity corrections**: Quantum gravity effects at Planck scale (such as black hole entropy, gravitational wave polarization) are 4D projection results of higher-dimensional twist fields.

- **Fractal spacetime effects**: Fractal structure of 4D universe (such as fractal dimension of galaxy distribution) reflects fractal characteristics of higher-dimensional universe.

- **Dark energy and dark matter**: Dark energy is negative pressure effect of higher-dimensional twist fields, dark matter is 4D projection of higher-dimensional matter fields.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Outlook

### 6.1 Core Conclusions

Based on the "Fixed 4D Topology - Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, combined with fractal Clifford algebra and multi-twist quantization scheme, this module proposes a new theory of cosmic evolution after black hole remnants and the nature of higher-dimensional universe. Main conclusions include:

1. **Dynamic equilibrium state theory**: The universe after black hole remnants enters a dynamic equilibrium state, rather than traditional heat death state. This equilibrium state is the unification of macroscopic evolution stagnation and microscopic quantum activity, with entropy reaching maximum value and remaining constant.

2. **Resonance shockwave phase transition mechanism**: Black hole remnants may trigger resonance shockwave phase transitions under specific conditions, initiating chain reactions, breaking equilibrium states, and causing the universe to enter new evolution cycles.

3. **4D universe higher-dimensional projection model**: 4D universe is a dynamic projection of higher-dimensional universe at specific depths, and its evolution is driven by spectral dimension evolution. Multiple 4D universes superpose at quantum level and decohere into single universes with spectral dimension evolution.

4. **Fractal-twist structure of higher-dimensional universe**: Higher-dimensional universe has fixed total topological dimension ($D_{\text{total}} = 12$) and dynamic fractal-twist structure, is boundless and open. Its physical laws are unified, and physical laws of 4D universe are the result of its projection symmetry breaking.

5. **Cyclic mode of cosmic evolution**: Cosmic evolution is a unified process of dynamic equilibrium and evolution cycles, without absolute beginning or end. Black hole remnants are not the ultimate endpoint of the universe, but potential starting points for new evolution cycles.

### 6.2 Observational Predictions

The theoretical framework proposed in this module can provide the following observable predictions:

1. **Observational effects of black hole remnants**: As dark matter candidates, black hole remnants can be observed through microlensing events, gravitational wave backgrounds, and non-Gaussianity of CMB power spectrum.

2. **Observational effects of resonance shockwave phase transitions**: If resonance shockwave phase transitions occur in the universe, they may produce high-intensity gravitational wave bursts or electromagnetic radiation bursts, which can be observed by future gravitational wave detectors or telescopes.

3. **Observational effects of higher-dimensional projection**: Projection effects of higher-dimensional universe can be observed through quantum gravity corrections, fractal spacetime effects, and characteristics of dark energy and dark matter.

4. **Observational effects of new physical laws**: If the universe enters new evolution cycles, new physical laws may emerge, which can be detected by high-precision experiments.

### 6.3 Future Research Directions

Research in this module provides new directions for future theoretical and experimental research, mainly including:

1. **Quantum gravity experimental verification**: Further study observational effects of black hole remnants and design experiments to verify quantum gravity corrections.

2. **Mathematical models of higher-dimensional universe**: Develop more complete mathematical models of higher-dimensional universe and deeply study specific forms of higher-dimensional physical laws.

3. **Numerical simulations of cosmic evolution**: Carry out numerical simulations of cosmic evolution after black hole remnants to verify resonance shockwave phase transition mechanism and 4D universe movement mechanism in higher-dimensional space.

4. **Exploration of new physical laws**: Explore new physical laws that may emerge after the universe enters new evolution cycles, providing theoretical guidance for future experimental research.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Theoretical Background and Motivation

Strong interaction, as one of the four fundamental interactions, describes the interaction between quarks. Its theoretical foundation is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Traditional QCD is based on SU(3) gauge field theory, with relatively complex mathematical forms lacking intuitiveness. Classical electromagnetic theory's Maxwell's equations have concise and elegant forms, providing an intuitive framework for understanding electromagnetic interaction.

Based on the **"Fixed 4D Topological Dimension + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm**, we have established a unified field theory framework in [P-1], tracing gauge symmetry back to the geometric origin of multi-twist. The motivation of this module is to derive Maxwell-type equations for strong interaction under this framework, achieving formal unification of strong interaction with classical electromagnetic theory, providing more intuitive mathematical descriptions for understanding strong interaction.

### 1.2 Overview of Theoretical Framework

The theoretical framework of this module is based on the following core principles:

1. **Fixed 4D Topology:** Maintains 4D spacetime topology unchanged, ensuring compatibility with relativity and experimental observations
2. **Dynamic Spectral Dimension:** Takes spectral dimension as dynamic parameter, describing measure-energy dependence of spacetime, solving ultraviolet divergence problem of quantum gravity
3. **Multi-Twist Mechanism:** Traces SU(3) gauge symmetry back to geometric origin of triple twist
4. **Formal Unification:** Establishes formal correspondence between strong interaction and Maxwell's equations, maintaining consistency of mathematical structure

### 1.3 Connection with Preceding and Following Modules

- **Connection with [M-1]:** Uses Clifford algebra, Lie algebra, and representation theory as mathematical tools
- **Connection with [M-2]:** Inherits "Fixed Topological Dimension + Dynamic Spectral Dimension" core paradigm, applies fractal measure theory
- **Connection with [M-3]:** Combines triple-twist mechanism, realizes geometric origin of SU(3) gauge symmetry

## 2 Mathematical Foundation of Strong Interaction

### 2.1 Mathematical Structure of SU(3) Gauge Group

**SU(3) Gauge Group** is the symmetry group of strong interaction, with mathematical structure described by the following characteristics:

- **Lie Algebra:** su(3) Lie algebra consists of 8 generators $T^a$ (Gell-Mann matrices), satisfying commutation relations:
  $$[T^a, T^b] = if^{abc} T^c$$
  Where $f^{abc}$ are SU(3) structure constants, reflecting non-Abelian characteristics.

- **Group Representation:** Quark fields belong to 3-dimensional representation (triplet) of SU(3), antiquark fields belong to 3-dimensional conjugate representation (anti-triplet), and gluon fields belong to 8-dimensional adjoint representation (octet).

### 2.2 Color Covariant Derivative and Gauge Field Strength Tensor

**Color Covariant Derivative** is the derivative operator describing the covariant properties of quark fields under SU(3) gauge transformation:

$$D_\mu = \partial_\mu - i g_s f^{abc} A_\mu^b T^c$$

Where:
- $g_s$ is the strong interaction coupling constant
- $A_\mu^a$ is the gluon field (gauge potential)
- $T^c$ is the SU(3) generator

**Gauge Field Strength Tensor** describes the strength and direction of gluon fields:

$$G_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_{\nu}^a - \partial_\nu A_{\mu}^a + g_s f^{abc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c$$

Where the second term reflects the self-interaction of gluon fields, which is the core manifestation of non-Abelian characteristics of strong interaction.

### 2.3 Geometric Realization of Triple Twist

According to the multi-twist theory of [M-3], SU(3) gauge symmetry corresponds to **triple twist**, with geometric realization:

- **Topological Analogy:** Triple twist corresponds to "three-strand rope twisted structure", different rope combinations correspond to different color charge states
- **Twist Strength:** Triple twist strength $\tau$ describes the intensity of twist, corresponding to coupling strength of strong interaction
- **Dynamic Topological Transformation:** Describes dynamic evolution of twist structure, corresponding to propagation and interaction of gluon fields

### 2.4 Dynamic Spectral Dimension and Measure Field

**Dynamic Spectral Dimension** is the core innovation of this theory. Spectral dimension $d_s(E)$ changes with energy scale $E$, approaching 2 at high energy and 4 at low energy. Dynamic spectral dimension is realized through **measure field** $\mu(x)$, with measure field defined as:

$$\mu(B(x,r)) \sim r^{Q(x)}$$

Where $Q(x)$ is the local Ahlfors index, describing the fractal characteristics of spacetime.

## 3 Maxwell-Type Equations for Strong Interaction

### 3.1 Homogeneous Equations: Bianchi Identities

**Homogeneous Bianchi Identities** describe topological constraints of gluon fields, similar to Faraday's law and Gauss's law for magnetism in Maxwell's equations:

$$\nabla^\lambda G_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a + f^{abc} G_{\lambda\mu}^b G_{\nu}^{\lambda c} + \tau \nabla^\lambda \widetilde{G}_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a = 0$$

Where:
- $G_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a = \nabla_\lambda G_{\mu\nu}^a + \nabla_\mu G_{\nu\lambda}^a + \nabla_\nu G_{\lambda\mu}^a$ is the triple curl of gauge field strength tensor
- $\widetilde{G}_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\lambda\mu\nu\rho} \widetilde{G}^{a\rho\sigma} \epsilon_{\sigma\tau\alpha\beta} \partial^\tau A^{a\alpha} \partial^\beta A^{a\gamma}$ is the triple curl of dual gauge field strength tensor
- $\tau$ is the triple twist strength

**Physical Significance:** Homogeneous Bianchi Identities describe source-free and topological constraints of gluon fields, reflecting non-Abelian characteristics and geometric effects of multi-twist of strong interaction.

### 3.2 Inhomogeneous Equations: Yang-Mills Equations

**Inhomogeneous Yang-Mills Equations** describe the interaction between gluon fields and quark currents, similar to Gauss's law and Ampère-Maxwell law in Maxwell's equations:

$$D^\nu G_{\nu\mu}^a + g_f D^\nu \left(\mu(x) G_{\nu\mu}^a\right) + \tau D^\nu \widetilde{G}_{\nu\mu}^a = J_\mu^a$$

Where:
- $D^\nu = \nabla^\nu - i g_s f^{abc} A^{b\nu}$ is the color covariant derivative
- $\widetilde{G}_{\nu\mu}^a = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\nu\mu\rho\sigma} G^{a\rho\sigma}$ is the dual gauge field strength tensor
- $\mu(x)$ is the fractal measure field
- $g_f$ is the measure field-gluon coupling constant
- $J_\mu^a$ is the quark current, with form:
  $$J_\mu^a = -i g_s \bar{q} \gamma_\mu T^a q$$

**Physical Significance:** Inhomogeneous Yang-Mills Equations describe the excitation of gluon fields by quark currents, containing self-interaction of gluon fields, measure field corrections, and twist corrections, reflecting the complex dynamics of strong interaction.

### 3.3 Measure Field Equations

**Measure Field Equations** describe the evolution of dynamic spectral dimension, coupled with strong interaction fields:

$$\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu \ln\mu = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \ln\mu} + g_f G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a\mu\nu}$$

Where:
- $V(\ln\mu)$ is the potential function of the measure field, with form:
  $$V(\ln\mu) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 (\ln\mu)^2 + \lambda (\ln\mu)^4$$
- $g_f G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a\mu\nu}$ is the feedback term of gluon fields on the measure field

**Physical Significance:** Measure Field Equations reflect the mutual influence between dynamic spectral dimension and strong interaction, describing the evolution of spacetime fractal characteristics.

### 3.4 Complete Form of Equation System

The Maxwell-type equations for strong interaction consist of the following three equations:

1. **Homogeneous Bianchi Identities:**
   $$\nabla^\lambda G_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a + f^{abc} G_{\lambda\mu}^b G_{\nu}^{\lambda c} + \tau \nabla^\lambda \widetilde{G}_{\lambda\mu\nu}^a = 0$$

2. **Inhomogeneous Yang-Mills Equations:**
   $$D^\nu G_{\nu\mu}^a + g_f D^\nu \left(\mu(x) G_{\nu\mu}^a\right) + \tau D^\nu \widetilde{G}_{\nu\mu}^a = J_\mu^a$$

3. **Measure Field Equations:**
   $$\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu \ln\mu = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \ln\mu} + g_f G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a\mu\nu}$$

This equation system completely describes the dynamics of strong interaction, containing non-Abelian characteristics, multi-twist effects, and dynamic spectral dimension.

## 5 Physical Effects of Equation System

### 5.1 Non-Abelian Self-Interaction

The non-Abelian characteristics of strong interaction equations lead to self-interaction of gluon fields, producing the following physical effects:

- **Asymptotic Freedom:** At high energy, strong interaction coupling constant decreases with increasing energy, and quarks can move freely
- **Infrared Slavery:** At low energy, strong interaction coupling constant increases with decreasing energy, leading to quark confinement
- **Gluon Self-Coupling:** Gluons can directly interact with each other, forming bound states such as glueballs

### 5.2 Multi-Twist Corrections

Triple twist corrections introduce topological effects, producing the following physical effects:

- **Gluon Spectrum Splitting:** Multi-twist causes gluon spectrum to split into different twist modes
- **Topological Mechanism of Quark Confinement:** Twist forms topological imprisonment, confining quarks in "topological tubes" of twist
- **Geometric Origin of CP Violation:** Twist topological invariants determine CP violation phase

### 5.3 Dynamic Spectral Dimension Effects

Dynamic spectral dimension is realized through measure fields, producing the following physical effects:

- **Resolution of Ultraviolet Divergence:** At high energy, spectral dimension approaches 2, avoiding ultraviolet divergence of quantum gravity
- **Gauge Coupling Unification:** Coupling constants of different interactions unify at high energy
- **Fractal Characteristics of Spacetime:** Spacetime exhibits fractal structure at small scales

### 5.4 Topological Mechanism of Quark Confinement

Based on the strong interaction equations, the topological mechanism of quark confinement can be described as:

- **Topological String Model:** Interaction between quarks is described by topological twist strings, with string tension proportional to twist strength
- **Confinement Potential:** The potential energy between quarks is:
  $$V(r) = -\frac{\alpha_s(r)}{r} + \sigma(\tau) r$$
  Where $\sigma(\tau) = \sigma_0 \tau^2$ is the string tension
- **Area Law Behavior:** Wilson loop satisfies area law $W(C) \sim e^{-\sigma A(C)}$, meaning the potential energy between quark-antiquark pairs grows linearly with distance

## 6 Experimental Predictions

### 6.1 High-Energy Collider Signals

This theory predicts various new physics signals at high-energy colliders:

- **Running Corrections of Gauge Coupling Constants:** In LHC and future FCC-ee experiments, observe spectral dimension and twist-dependent corrections of strong coupling constant
  - Expected deviation: $\Delta\alpha_s(Q) \sim 10^{-3}$ at $Q=1$ TeV

- **Gluon Spectrum Corrections:** Gluon spectrum obtains twist-induced splitting, which can be probed through precise measurement of gluon jet characteristics

- **New Particle Resonance States:** Multi-twist predicts new resonance states between TeV and $10^{16}$ GeV, corresponding to excitations of different twist modes

### 6.2 Proton Decay

Gauge coupling unification predicts proton decay, with lifetime prediction given by this theory:

$$\tau_p \sim 10^{36-38}$$ years

Close to current experimental upper limit ($10^{34}$ years), verifiable through large underground detectors such as Super-Kamiokande and DUNE.

### 6.3 Quark-Gluon Plasma

This theory predicts that thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma obtain fractal-twist corrections:

- Corrections to energy density and pressure
- Changes in viscosity coefficients
- Shifts in phase transition temperatures

These predictions can be verified through heavy ion collision experiments such as RHIC and LHC.

### 6.4 Gluon Spectrum Corrections

The twist correction formula for gluon mass is:

$$m_{g,a} = m_0 \sqrt{\tau_a^2 + \frac{1}{3} \tau_a^4}$$

Where $m_0 \sim 10^{-5}$ eV is the base mass, and $\tau_a$ is the twist strength of the $a$-th gluon. This correction can be probed through precise measurement of gluon propagator characteristics.

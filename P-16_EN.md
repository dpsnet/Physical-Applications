## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

In traditional quantum mechanics, photons as mediator particles of electromagnetic interaction satisfy the relationship $E = h\nu$ between frequency $\nu$ and energy $E$. However, traditional theories have not provided clear geometric explanations for the geometric origin of photon frequency, the energy difference mechanism for spinors with the same quantum numbers, and the formation mechanism of continuous frequency spectra.

In the "Fixed 4D Topology-Dynamic Spectral Dimension Multi-Twist Fractal Clifford Algebra Unified Field Theory," photons correspond to the single twist mode of U(1) gauge symmetry, and their frequency directly corresponds to the frequency of fractal high-speed twist. Based on the spinor coarse-grained quantization theory, this module reinterprets photon frequency phenomena from the geometric perspective of fractal spacetime.

### 1.2 Traditional Interpretation of Photon Frequency

**Traditional Quantum Mechanics:**
- Photon energy: $E = h\nu$
- Photon frequency: $\nu = E/h$
- Frequency spectrum: Continuous distribution

**Dilemmas:**
- Geometric origin of photon frequency is unclear
- Energy differences of spinors with the same quantum numbers cannot be explained
- Formation mechanism of continuous frequency spectrum is unclear

1. Establish the spinor origin theory of photon frequency
2. Explain the energy difference mechanism for spinors with the same quantum numbers
3. Derive the formation mechanism of frequency spectra
4. Establish the frequency filtering effect of coarse-grained quantization
5. Derive the relationship between photon frequency and energy scale

This module adopts the following research methods:
1. Starting from the quantization conditions of fractal high-speed twist, derive the discrete spectrum of twist frequencies
2. Starting from the equivalence class division of spinor coarse-grained quantization, establish the mathematical structure of coarse-graining groups
3. Starting from the scale relationships of fractal geometry, derive energy differences of spinors with the same quantum numbers
4. Starting from the discrete origin of frequency spectra, explain the formation mechanism of continuous frequency spectra
5. Starting from experimental observations, verify theoretical predictions

## 2 Coarse-Grained Quantization Mechanism of Spinors

### 2.1 Quantization of Fractal High-Speed Twist

Fractal high-speed twist satisfies the quantization condition:
$$\oint \omega^f(x,t) \cdot d\mathbf{x} = n \hbar$$

From this, the discrete energy spectrum is derived:
$$\omega_n = \frac{n \hbar}{I}$$

Where $I = m_0 r^2$ is the moment of inertia, and $n$ is the integer quantum number.

### 2.2 Mathematical Definition of Coarse-Graining Process

Coarse-graining is the process of discretizing the continuous fractal high-speed twist spectrum into finite multi-twist states:
$$\tau_m = \sum_{n \in G_m} \omega_n^f$$

Where $G_m$ is the $m$-th coarse-graining group, corresponding to different gauge symmetries:
- Single twist ($m=1$): $G_1 = \{1,4,7,10,...\}$ → U(1) symmetry → Photon
- Double twist ($m=2$): $G_2 = \{2,5,8,11,...\}$ → SU(2) symmetry → Weak bosons
- Triple twist ($m=3$): $G_3 = \{3,6,9,12,...\}$ → SU(3) symmetry → Gluons

### 2.3 Essence of Spinor Coarse-Grained Quantization

Spinor coarse-grained quantization is the **equivalence class division of fractal helical torsion modes**, with the following characteristics:
1. Twist modes within the same coarse-graining group have similar topological properties
2. Energy differences between different modes within the group are "averaged" into a single multi-twist intensity
3. Coarse-graining preserves topological information but blurs microscopic energy details

## 3 Spinor Origin of Photon Frequency

### 3.1 Photons Corresponding to Ground State of Single Twist

Photons as U(1) gauge bosons mainly correspond to the **ground state mode** ($n=1$) of single twist, with twist frequency:
$$\omega_1 = \frac{\hbar}{I}$$

In traditional quantum mechanics, photon energy $E = h\nu$ corresponds to twist energy in this theory:
$$E = \hbar \omega$$

Therefore, photon frequency $\nu$ directly corresponds to twist frequency $\omega$:
$$\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$$

### 3.2 Correspondence Between Different Frequency Photons and Spinors

**Photons of different frequencies correspond to single twist modes of different quantum numbers $n$**, specifically manifested as:

1. **Low-energy photons:** Mainly correspond to $n=1$ ground state mode, energy $E_1 = \hbar \omega_1$
2. **Medium-energy photons:** Include $n=4,7$ and other excited state modes, energy $E = \sum_{n \in G_1, n \leq N} \hbar \omega_n$
3. **High-energy photons:** Include more high-order modes, energy $E = \sum_{n \in G_1} \hbar \omega_n$ (continuous spectrum limit)

### 3.3 Connection Between Spinor Coarse-Graining and Photon Frequency

The influence of spinor coarse-graining on photon frequency is manifested as:

1. **Frequency Discretization:** Discrete modes within coarse-graining groups correspond to discrete frequencies
2. **Frequency Range:** Modes within the same coarse-graining group cover a certain frequency range
3. **Frequency Continuity:** Mode frequencies of different coarse-graining groups may overlap, forming continuous frequency spectra

## 4 Energy Differences of Same Quantum Number Spinors

### 4.1 Energy Differences Caused by Fractal Structure

Spinors with the same quantum number $n$, due to the self-similarity of fractal structure, actually contain different energies:

1. **Fractal Scale Differences:** Same quantum number modes at different spatial scales have different fractal helical densities $\omega_n^f(x)$
2. **Self-Similar Scaling:** Satisfies $\omega^f(\lambda x, \lambda^{-\alpha} t) = \lambda^{-\beta} \omega^f(x,t)$, leading to different energies at different scales
3. **Mode Overlap:** Same quantum number $n$ has overlapping modes at different fractal levels, contributing different energies

### 4.2 Mathematical Derivation: Energy Differences of Same Quantum Numbers

For the same quantum number $n$, the twist energy at different fractal scales is:
$$E_n(\lambda) = \int_M |\omega_n^f(\lambda x)|^2 d\mu$$

According to the self-similar relationship $\omega_n^f(\lambda x) = \lambda^{-\beta} \omega_n^f(x)$ and fractal measure $d\mu(\lambda x) = \lambda^{d_H} d\mu(x)$ ($d_H$ is Hausdorff dimension), we obtain:
$$E_n(\lambda) = \lambda^{-2\beta + d_H} \int_M |\omega_n^f(x)|^2 d\mu = \lambda^{d_H - 2\beta} E_n(1)$$

Therefore, spinors with the same quantum number $n$ have different energies at different fractal scales $\lambda$, with an energy ratio of $\lambda^{d_H - 2\beta}$.

### 4.3 Physical Meaning: Connection Between Frequency and Fractal Scale

The relationship between photon frequency and fractal scale is:
$$\nu(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{d_H - 2\beta - 1}$$

This explains why **spinors with the same quantum number contain different energies**:
- Different fractal scales correspond to photons of different frequencies
- The same quantum number $n$ is realized as photons of different energies at different scales
- Spinor coarse-grained quantization groups these different scale modes into the same equivalence class

## 5 Formation Mechanism of Photon Frequency Spectrum

### 5.1 Discrete Origin of Continuous Frequency Spectrum

The continuous frequency spectrum of photons is actually a **continuous distribution of discrete quantization modes on fractal scales**:

1. Each fractal scale $\lambda$ corresponds to a set of discrete quantization modes
2. Mode frequency ranges of different scales overlap
3. Macroscopically manifested as continuous frequency spectrum

### 5.2 Frequency Filtering Effect of Coarse-Grained Quantization

Spinor coarse-graining has a "filtering" effect on photon frequency:

1. **Low-energy filtering:** Low-energy photons mainly propagate through ground state modes ($n=1$)
2. **High-energy filtering:** High-energy photons can excite more high-order modes
3. **Frequency selectivity:** Different frequency photons couple with different coarse-graining modes

### 5.3 Experimental Verification: Relationship Between Photon Frequency and Energy Scale

According to theoretical predictions, the relationship between photon frequency and energy scale $\mu$ is:
$$\nu(\mu) \propto \mu^{d_s(\mu) - 2}$$

Where $d_s(\mu)$ is the dynamic spectral dimension.

   - Spinor coarse-grained quantization groups these different energy modes into the same equivalence class

3. **Formation Mechanism of Frequency Spectrum:** The continuous frequency spectrum of photons is a continuous distribution of discrete quantization modes on fractal scales, with spinor coarse-graining having a filtering effect on frequencies

### 6.2 Physical Significance
